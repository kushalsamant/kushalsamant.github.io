  <h1>Thinking</h1>

  <p>
    If you work independently, you already know the problem.
    Thoughts get scattered. Useful ideas disappear into old notes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Work gets messy. Decisions repeat.
    Trying to keep everything in your head becomes mentally exhausting over time.
  </p>

  <h2>A simple way to organize thinking</h2>

  <p>
    This is a growing collection of notes, frameworks, and working material
    meant to support long-term practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    No noise. No hype. No unnecessary complexity.
  </p>

  <h2>Why people keep a thinking library</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keeps ideas and decisions in one place</li>
    <li>Reduces repeated mental effort</li>
    <li>Useful for independent and creative work</li>
    <li>Designed to grow slowly over time</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top: 24px;">
    This is where extended notes and downloadable resources are collected.

    and makes consistent work easier to sustain.
