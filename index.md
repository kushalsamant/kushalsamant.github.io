Here you can see what I’ve shipped recently, what I’m building next, and how I’m doing as an architect. By sharing this information I aim to demystify the weird and wonderful process of working on mostly bootstrapped projects.

I’m working hard to build a mindful, respectful, and accountable space for my patrons. I’ve lots of ideas for how to do a better job, as well as lots of challenges.

This is meant to be as transparent as reasonably possible. Since I’m accountable to my patrons instead of advertisers, my incentive is to create meaningful projects.

This also means that my future relies entirely on community contributions. Here’s how you can help: If you’re already following my content and want to chip in a little extra, you can support me <a href="https://kushalsamant.github.io/wordpress_db" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
