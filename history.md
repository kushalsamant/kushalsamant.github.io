## Projects

These are the projects/ventures I've worked on.

## sketch2bim

**sketch2bim** is an experimental open-source repository exploring the translation of early-stage architectural sketch thinking into structured, machine-readable BIM logic.

The project investigates how loose, designer-first workflows (such as SketchUp-style massing and conceptual geometry) can be incrementally formalized into parametric, rule-based building information without forcing premature rigidity or software lock-in.

Rather than attempting direct file-format conversion, sketch2bim focuses on encoding architectural intent early in the design process, so that spatial decisions, proportions, and construction logic remain traceable as projects move toward documentation, fabrication, or automation.

The repository sits at the intersection of architectural research, scripting, and open-source construction systems, and functions as a research tool, teaching aid, and foundation for future automation workflows in BIM and digital construction.

## Anthology

This collection of writings touches upon various aspects of the human experience, from the profound to the mundane. Several entries reflect on personal struggles and emotions, discussing topics like finding love, dealing with loneliness, overcoming anxiety, and accepting imperfection. Other pieces explore societal observations and personal philosophies, such as the perceived hierarchy in modern life, the influence of technology, the importance of conscious choices for happiness, and the power of consistency in achieving goals. Practical advice on topics like decluttering life, managing online presence, and developing productive habits is also shared, alongside more abstract musings on the nature of creativity, understanding others, and the influence of our surroundings.
