**Get in Touch**.

If you’d like to reach out - whether it’s to say hello, share feedback, ask a question, or talk through an idea - I’d love to hear from you. The easiest way to connect with me casually is on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/kvshvl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, where I try to respond to as many posts and messages as I can.

For deeper conversations - business ideas, project collaborations, sharing something you’ve made, or anything that requires focused time and energy - the best way to connect is through a **1:1 consultation**. This ensures I can give you my undivided attention without the chaos of an overloaded inbox or the interruptions of a scattered schedule.

I protect my time carefully because family comes first, work second, and whatever’s left I use to recharge (usually through travel). By keeping a structured consultation process, I can show up fully present and give you the best of my creative and professional energy.
