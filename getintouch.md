**Get in Touch**

If you’d like to reach out: whether it’s to say hello, share feedback, ask a question, or talk through an idea: I’d love to hear from you. The easiest way to connect with me casually is on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/kvshvl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, where I try to respond to as many posts and messages as I can.

For deeper conversations: business ideas, project collaborations, sharing something you’ve made, or anything that requires focused time and energy: the best way to connect is through a **1:1 consultation**. This ensures I can give you my undivided attention without the chaos of an overloaded inbox or the interruptions of a scattered schedule.

I protect my time carefully, prioritizing family first, work second, and recharging (usually through travel) with whatever’s left, so that by keeping a structured consultation process I can show up fully present and give you the best of my creative and professional energy. Both <a href="http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paul Graham’s essay on the maker’s schedule</a> and <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2017/01/to-everyone-who-asks-for-just-a-little-of-your-time" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ryan Holiday’s piece on time requests</a> capture why this matters: they’re worth a read if you’re curious.

If you’d like to explore how my brain works, you can dive into essays I’ve published on <a href="https://kvshvl.medium.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medium</a>, or find my books on <a href="https://kvshvl.gumroad.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gumroad</a>. I also share inspiration on <a href="https://in.pinterest.com/kvshvl/_saved/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, snapshots of life and work on <a href="https://instagram.com/kvshvl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, videos on <a href="https://youtube.com/@kvshvl/videos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, and professional updates on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/kvshvl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
