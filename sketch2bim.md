## Sketch2BIM.

**What it is**: <a href="https://github.com/kushalsamant/sketch2bim" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sketch2BIM</a> is an open-source experiment that studies how rough architectural sketches and simple massing models can slowly become clear, structured building data.

**Why it exists**: It tries to keep the freedom of early design thinking while avoiding the pressure to decide everything too early or get stuck inside one software.

**How it works**: Instead of converting files directly, it records design intent like spaces, sizes, and relationships so ideas stay understandable as the project develops.

**What it explores**: It looks at how sketchy forms can turn into rules, parameters, and logic that computers can understand without killing creativity.

**Who it is for**: It is useful for students, researchers, and designers who want to learn how design thinking connects to BIM, automation, and construction systems.

**What it can become**: The project acts as a base for future tools that link design, documentation, fabrication, and digital construction workflows.
