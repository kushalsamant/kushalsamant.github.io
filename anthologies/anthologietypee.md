She: Idiot. Don't get slow while being smitten

He: What do you mean?

She: You're so smitten by me you're getting slowwwww.

He: Slowwwww about?

She: Are you getting the adrenaline rush you're looking for with this chat?

He: I am not. I want that rip your clothes apart and push you on the wall, and kiss you, and bite your neck rush

She: Wow.

He: Are you?

She: I'm enjoying this, in a sadistic fashion

He: Dominating much?

She: Haha. Not in bed

He: I am. In bed.

She: In general I don't know. I like being dominated in bed

He: But it wears off

She: Why would it

He: Like I can make you want to fuck me because I will be essential fucking a stranger of sorts when we do it the first time.

She: Was more of it yesterday. Law of marginally diminishing utility applies on everything I guess

He: Then the next time I am more careful about if you are experiencing pain or pleasure. So I tone down

She: Accha

He: That's for objects.

She: But dominance can still be there na

He: Yes it will be

She: Holds true for people also.

He: You don't want me to be maddening wild

She: Why not

He: Trust me I don't fair well when I am thinking

She: Fuck I have a headache. Sorry not to be whining

He: Like I will shut off my brain and treat you like you are my bitch. Waiting to be punished, handled rough. That's only for the first time. Then once I figure what you like, I focus more on giving you pleasure. And that sucks for you.

She: Why? Why would it suck?

He: Because I like looking at you when you are being treated rough. That's my turn on, and I don't want it easy

She: I see

He: I like being forceful. But that's fucking you.

She: Interesting

He: Making love to you will be more gentle. And when I am dating you, I would not want to fuck you. I will want to make love to you. Making love is not fucking for me. I am still trying to understand scenarios where fucking is acceptable when dating someone. Like I want to have real reasons to put you through that. And I don't mean anger. Only obedience

She: Elaborate

He: Complicated? Or can you see the difference?

She: Can see

He: This will lead us to sexting

She: Short replies cause eyes closing.

He: Making you go down on me at the door. Making sure you are rough while you handle me. This is the key. The energy you get is the same as the energy you give. 

She: Eyes will open with sexting.

He: Bitch

She: What if I can't be rough

He: Then I will throw you on the bed. Be an arsonist

She: And?

He: Do things you ask me to stop. Like don't spoil my make up. Pull your hair. Turn you around

She: Keep talking!

He: Keep touching. 

He: Take off all our clothes. Rip them away. Choke you. Bite your lips

She: Love that.

He: When you are down on me, slap you with my boner. Keep it on your lips. Hold your head in both my hands. Keep your hair back. And make you go deep throat. Then lift you up. Let you stand. Face in the wall. And keep that boner on your ass. And dry hump you. Or add some lube. And pin your hands on the wall. And turn your head to the side. And kiss you. With my whole weight on you. While your legs can't take it anymore

She: You meant it when you said rough!

He: Yes I did. Then go on the bed. Rub your clit with my boner

She: Oh boy. You're doing things to me now.

He: Make you say everything mean about yourself. Roleplay being someone who really wants me. And then suck on your nipples. Put your legs on my shoulders. And spit on your clit. Then slide my boner right inside

She: Go on...

He: As deep as 7" can go. And then fuck you very slowly. Making you feel every bit of me. Hold your head in my hands. And keep fucking you. With my lips on your collar bones, then turn you around, ask you to get into doggy style positions, and keep both my arms on your ass. Spank you. Multiple times. Pull your hair backwards. Ask you to lay your chest flat on the bed /whatever, and spit on your clit, and rub my boner on your clit, and slide it in. Then keep my entire weight on your shoulders, and fuck you. When your face goes red, and you moan because you can't take it anymore, and then bend forward, and kiss you while doing you doggy, and then come back up, rest my hands on your ass.

She: Can't really

He: And fuck you like I intend to pass out fucking you, while making sure that you are pressed down with your face sideways in the bed, and then do you till you orgasm, multiple times. Run my fingers on your back, gently while at it, and then scratch your back with my nails, and fuck you till I cum, rather get it out after you have cum, and you will cum first, usually.

She: Ahaan!

He: Then make you lie on your chest on the bed, and dry hump you. Maybe with some lube because then it the frictionless humping gets me a boner sooner, and then repeat. Missionary. And doggy. And all the rough holds.

She: Stop

He: and make you come to my cock as quickly as you can when I tell you that baby I am going to cum, and cum on your face. Forehead. Until it drips all the way down your face, and then kiss you, and go down to eat you up, and use my beard, and the tip of my tongue, to tease your clit, kiss it, suck on it, maybe bite gently, and not stop.

She: Stopppp!

He: Until my face is lathered in your precum, all of it, from forehead to my chin. My beard wet as hell, and then maybe if I don't have a boner or run out of lube, maybe I will stop. Expect get spat on your face followed by kisses, cum on your face, spanking, choking, or nail marks on your back, shoulders, thighs, and yes! If I am well rested the night before and freshened up on time, then this can go on for 6 hours if I really really like you. 10pm to 2am, and 4am to 7am.

She: Are you mad?

He: I don't know. So tell me, do you want me to make love to you? or do you want me to fuck you?

He: I want us to be this wild

She: Dare I say the former?

He: No bitch. I am going to make sure you deserve all of this

She: Ouch.

He: :P Phew!

She: I want one full brownie now. Okay. Let me get to work

He: Are you talking about sucking my balls?

She: 😄 No.

He: And running your tongue from the bottom to top of my cock? And then spitting on the long iron rod of a boner. And swallowing it. And everything that can come out of it. Rubbing your lipstick off with that cock...

**Erotica 15**.

Hearing the phone buzz, I hear you move and stir around. I call you back to bed and you slide back into bed, so hard and so upright that I feel you right up against me. 

You instantly pull me closer and thrust yourself deep into me without warning waking me up to a moan so loud you have to cover my mouth. And I feel you filled up inside me fucking me with everything you've got and holding my hair in one hand and my tits in another. 

I turn to you, take your head and pull it close to my mouth, hold you close enough to kiss you, peck your nose, and take your mouth into mine hearing you moan. I bite your lip and tug on it with my teeth and hands are all up in your hair scrunching it up and I push you down on the bed and get right on top of you not leaving your mouth for even a breath. 

While I kiss your mouth with all I've got, you feel my tits near your neck and grab them making me moan and arch my back just so you get a second of air. I'm gonna clamber in pleasure down on you collapsing with my tits in your face and my hair all over you, while I push you down, holding your head and push your face into my wet and wanting pussy. 

As you eat me out I hold your head down on me and my back arches as I edge so close to coming in your mouth. And you grab me hard and push your tongue into me deeper and I explode all over your face. 

You pull me roughly to you, and kiss me so I can taste myself off your mouth and thrust into me taking me in every which way and holding me all up in your arms and fucking me until you hear me screaming your name and you force your tongue into my mouth. While I'm sucking on your mouth, you hold me down and bite my neck as I push my fingernails into your back and ask you to go faster. 

And you feel me shudder around you and then feel me biting your shoulder and pulling your hair. You pull out, and get on top of me...

**Erotica 5**.

I want to meet you in a wedding, find you in the crowd, from the other family's side. Look at you, and catch your gaze. I ask you, "Do you know where the rooms are?" I let you grab my hand, and show me where. Then let you go there with the keys. I follow you there, and close the door. I rip away your saree on the door, go down on you, and eat your clit, till you beg me to stop, so I ask you to sit. Then I pull you by your saree by that knot on your navel, and undo your hair.

I turn you around, and press my cock on your ass. You can feel it through the clothes but you still moan. So I turn your neck, and nibble your lips, with my hand still on your clit. Then push you down, till your face is flat on the bed, with your ass up, and a vagina that's ready and wet. You undo my belt without seeing it, and gasp as you hold my boner, you ask me to fuck thee. Then I pin you down and slide it in, as slowly as I can, we hear the wedding drums begin.

I want to fuck you to that drumbeat, until you can't take it anymore, till you gasp for breathe slowly sweating, with my fingers pinching your nipples, and my teeth undoing your lingerie. As my sweat drips from my face, on your back and you ask me if I am done yet. I politely say, "No bitch, we aren't going home tonight!" You ask me to stop, and don't stop in the same line.

Then you say, "How about bringing your mouth to my boobs, slowly caressing them with your lips before sucking on my nipples" So I turn you around, and slide it in, going all missionary and tearing all your clothes, cup your boobs, and suck on both the nipples together. As you leave deep nail marks on my back, burning as our sweat runs over that.

As you pull at my hair, I ask if you are married, you say, "Yes, aren't we both?  "Stop thinking!" ... And fuck me harder please!" And when I finally come up for air, you kiss me hard, bite my lips, and let some blood out there. So I slow down because I don't want to quit, I hear your moans go louder than that drumbeat until I cum inside you once, and you ask me to do it all over again. You suck my balls, slowly chew on my cock. You say, "Don't you do it because you can never have enough of me" as I get a better boner.

You run your tongue from the bottom to the tip of my dick, I see you look up at me wide-eyed as you suck my dick and that turns me on even more. Then you clamp that head in between your lips and touch the tip with your tongue gently. As it gives me a freezing sensation, my body shivers, legs go weak, and I hold your hair with such a forceful grip, begging for mercy to let me live. You ask me to byheart your number before we leave because you want to ride me in your house's balcony.

You want me to lift you up, and fuck me in the cold wind, sweating while your husband is in the other room, fucking his colleagues, 3, maybe 4. So I let myself go, and my cock oozes with glee, you drop all of it on your forehead, and it drips down slowly, from besides your eyes, down your nose, over a lip, and some goes inside your mouth as you open to tongue my cock some more.

Then it drips down your chin like a never-ending river, drops on your chest, and rolls down your boobs, all the way down to your stomach, and navel. You blow me so hard, I fall exhausted on you. But my cock is now on your face, cumming away, till it goes to your clean-shaven pussy, and you scream, "oh! no, I don't want you to get me pregnant" So you rub it off as it overflows, down on the bed.

You say, "We have a mess of this place, let's run away before anyone knows! Also, hey! are you married!?" ... "You wish" So I get you, your clothes from the hotel room, then we slip away back into the crowd again. I look at you and catch your gaze. Pretending to never have known you, but now a flashback to go to time and again. 

Phew!

Erotica 5.

I want to meet you in a wedding, find you in the crowd, from the other family’s side. Look at you, and catch your gaze. I ask you, “Do you know where the rooms are?” I let you grab my hand, and show me where. Then let you go there with the keys. I follow you there, and close the door. I rip away your saree on the door, go down on you, and eat your clit, till you beg me to stop, so I ask you to sit. Then I pull you by your saree by that knot on your navel, and undo your hair.

I turn you around, and press my cock on your ass. You can feel it through the clothes but you still moan. So I turn your neck, and nibble your lips, with my hand still on your clit. Then push you down, till your face is flat on the bed, with your ass up, and a vagina that’s ready and wet. You undo my belt without seeing it, and gasp as you hold my boner, you ask me to fuck thee. Then I pin you down and slide it in, as slowly as I can, we hear the wedding drums begin.

I want to fuck you to that drumbeat, until you can’t take it anymore, till you gasp for breathe slowly sweating, with my fingers pinching your nipples, and my teeth undoing your lingerie.

**Erotica 4**.

I want to whisper in your ears, and tell you things that I will do to you to make you squirt. I want to kiss you, bite you, eat you, and make you moan like you have never been fucked before. I want to tease you, dominate you, order you around, tell you what to do, show you what you deserve. Treat you like you are my bitch, you are my dirty little slut. I want to make you suck my dick till I cum in your mouth.

Then kiss you when you are being a good girl, but if you are bad, then I will spank you really bad, hell, spank you anyway. I want to push you on to a wall, slap you as you stand there, then push you on to it by your neck, and then put my whole body on yours. Bite your ears, slide a arm under your thighs, and lift them up straight. Then slowly get one arm from behind your head, down to your panties, stretch that elastic and let it go, as it hits your waist and reminds you that it's me. 

Then slide that hand under your top, slowly encroaching your tits. Remove that bra, in a quick tug, and bite your lips, as it snaps out of place, and I throw it away. Then I pinch your hard nipples, and turn you around. Spank your ass, real gently once, and then real bad twice. I will push my finger from the top of your back to the bottom, and slowly slide it inside your pussy, while my face is buried inside your back, biting away at all that muscle.

Then as you get your hand and struggle with unbuckling me, you whip out my dick, all 7 inches of it. Tell me you are weak in your knees, such a convenient excuse, and fall right on them, to blow me to peace. You lick the tip, just a very subtle tease. Then you swallow it whole, keeping it dry, when you are dripping like a leaking tap. and you use both your hands to keep my cock in line. As you blow me and look me in the eye, you swallow my balls, and ask me to give you more!

So I slide down those panties and ask you to come to an abandoned van, we roll down all windows, climb on the bonnet, we are star gazing, but are we? Because I am entering you slowly, mm by mm, as you can feel me slide. I want to fuck you till you scream. Then take you to a bed in that van, throw you on the bed, and make love to you some more.

**Erotica 14**.

I want you to suck me dry, see your body flow, into voluptuous curves, in dim light, of a lamp shade.

As you walk back into the room, from the shower, wrapped in a towel, still wet everywhere, leaking like a running tap.

As you stand in front of me, seduce me true, watch my cock soar, in sheer lust, just for you.

Have you come over, right on top of me, pushing me back into bed, and grind away, till that boner slips inside you all by itself.

You can't help, but close your eyes, and take me in, take me in all the way, the whole 7 inches of it.

These inches of joy, that you are with me for, with you cumming all over it, yet you carry on, to tease me with your tits.

You pin my hands down, so I can't spank you, without putting up a fight, just to hold your neck/let you bite my fingers, as you fuck me right.

**Erotica 9**.

I want to trash talk to you like telling you what kind of a bitch you are, that I think that you are cheating on me, for which you need to be punished with spanking your ass, choking you, turning you around, rubbing my 7" boner on your fat fucking ass, kissing you hard while I am at it, then throwing you on the bed, and fucking you doggystyle. So do you want me to come over, and tear away your tee? I want to see your cleavage where I can park my boner. Just in case, you decide to go gentle on me. Because I won't let you catch a breath. Instead I will choke you, spank you, and if you are up for it then lose my mind, and slap you.

I want to bite you everywhere, running my fingers up and down your back slowly, while at it. I want to nail your back so hard, that you will feel marked like never before, and fuck you doggy style till you cum, but then not stop with it. I want to keep going for hours, pull your hair, and make you moan, make you call me everything and anything I want you to say. I want to role play with you, and make you count the times you cum until it's 12 in one condom. Then throw that condom away, and slap my 7" boner on your face, force it in your mouth, and get it all wet while you choke.

Then I want to slide it inside you, as rough as sex can get, almost consented rape. Then I want to fuck you harder till I cum all of me into you, yet keep going on it for an hour more till our faces are dripping with sweat. I want to turn you around, and kiss you right. First a gentle touch of our lips, then a nibble's delight. A bite, and tonguing all the way in, then go down on you, and eat you all up, while running a finger around your hard nipples till you cum.

I want to stay down there until you quiver, and shake, suck on your clit, and finger you till you squirt like my morning milkshake. Then eat you till my face is wet, and my beard is dripping in your cum. I want to pick you up, and turn you around, pin you on a wall, and rub my boner on your ass, before I make you go down on your knees, make you give me a sloppy fucking blowjob for an hour and a half, before I cum on your face as long as from your face it drips.

I dreamt of us. You met me at a cafe, you winked at me, and bite your lips, held my hand, and we ran into a closet.

In your office, behind the pantry, on conference tables, you sit. While I lean in to kiss you softly, you spread your legs. I hover my palms on your skin, neither touching or pressing, but only a slight presence that leaves you wanting, for more.

As I feel the warmth of your thighs build up with your moans, you run your fingers through my hair, holding my face as we kiss, guiding my head down, over your chocolate hills, into a flowing valley, and holding me there.

And I tease you with my beard tickling your panties. With my hands on your nipple, circling it slowly, and with patience. I wait until your moans grow so loud that everyone else in the office knows that you could not wait until day's end. Then I slid your wet panties off you, and let your skin feel my beard. As you force me to eat you.

I hold back restraining. To kiss your clit first, then nibble. So when you tell me, "Fuck baby! Eat me", I can swallow your pussy whole with my tongue on you. Going deeper every second. As slowly as we can, feeling every inch of progress I make. With my mouth full of your cum, and my saliva dripping right back on your clit. I release it drop by drop, tantalizing your labia in return.

A finger running slow, and deep. Making you believe that time is your enemy with all the pleasure that it brings you, and all the pain that you inflict on me. With your long nails, running all over my back. I howl in pain. To moan together in pleasure, we can't wait for you to dominate me, and then I will throw you on a bed and have you alone.

So here's how I really want you. Steamy, fresh after a bath with that first few buttons open, just enough for me to see the top of your cleavage. I want you to come to me when I get in the house, right on the main door. Then lay your hands on my shirt and push me back on the main door. Look at me in my eye, with a gaze that says, "You are mine." And as silent as you are on a cafe bench, I want you to grab my belt. No baby don't be gentle, just show me that you rule me, you are my queen. I want you to unbuckle the strap, and bite your lips. Come close enough to give me a kiss but don't give me any. Since you were planning to head out, and I interuptted your plans, I want you to be angry. You keep your bag next to me, on the floor near the wall, so that it doesn't get between you like I did. Then go down on your knees, and feel my cock from outside the pants. You undo the belt and unzip my pants. You pull out my hard on and say, "why is my package not a boner yet?" 

Hand me the belt, so you can use both your hands to treat me right. I want your complete attention. Look right at me, and keep my cock on your lips. No your lips are not wet, but they soon will be. So you rub off that dark red lipstick on my cock, bickering about the heat. SInce I want to go handfree, I pull your hair up, and lap that belt around your neck. I slide it in the buckle as the leather makes you feel that I am being in control. I let go off your hair, and pull on the strap. It makes the belt fasten around your delicate neck. You choke.

As I run my fingers on your mane, you close your eyes and kiss my cock...

I love eating you out, and hearing you moan, like a toy in my hands. I love sucking your tits, running my nails on your back. I want to tear away your tops. All of them. I want to give you continuous hickies. I want to get Honey, Nutella, Hershey's syrup, and peanut butter. I want to swallow your cum. Being horny is expensive, and you are the only expense I want. I want us to be dirty baby. Add some Mayonnaise please.

I want to rip away your delicate panties, and pull you by your legs, dragging you towards me on the bed, spit on your clit, and tongue it, deeper, and rub my lips on your clit. I want to try all of these, one by one. Let's start with honey, I want to eat you, while you eat breakfast, can you tease me some more baby! I want to be greedy for you. I want to suck hard on your pussy. Touch yourself right now. I want you to orgasm tonight. Now I wish you were here, baby let's just live in together? I cannot stay away from those hard nipples. So I want to eat pizza off you.

I want to fuck you with my rock hard boners, not the ones you have seen yet. I am hard enough to slap your face with my cock, and make you feel it on you. I want to cum tonight. I want you to wear a blouse the next time, if we are travelling then pack it and then change into a saree in the room. I want to fuck you with your saree on. I want to fucking make love to you like nobody's business. I want you baby, and I want to scream these words while we fuck. I want those words to echo in the room, while my thighs slap against your ass, and add a beat to make our sex sound like rap. We are never meeting outside again.

I can't take it anymore, or if we are then it's in an empty cafe, where I can fuck you on the couch, and you can be all naked, and be the cause of awe from all pedestrians on the roadside. I want you to wear low backs that tease me by almost revealing your ass. I want it all baby. Fuck me harder soon. I cannot think straight. I want you to be my art, and I want you to be mine. I want to fuck you in the rain in some private balcony, looking down on a city block. I want to kiss your neck, leave bites. I can't take this anymore. My cock is going to explode with cum, hall over your tits, navel, and body for sure. 

I want you to lick my cum off your tits. Then take you to the bathroom. I want you to hold the towel rod, and stay pinned there. Throw water on you while you're still wearing the blouse, while I do things to you on your belly. Then undo the hooks as slowly as I can. I am going to get you all wet baby, and be gentle as water flows on your skin, only to drink that water to quench my thirst, stop the droplets running down your boobs with my lips. I want to fuck you in a hot shower for hours everyday. I don't want to talk to you anymore. I want to be rubbing my cock hard. I just want to make rough love to you, and sneak away to be with you, slide one finger in baby, slide in two, stay there as you feel the way I finger you until your gspot and around.

It's getting cold here, the fan is on. I want you to shiver, as I throw my hot body on you, dry hump you without clothes, and bite you everywhere, on your thighs, ass, your abs, suck on your nipples, your neck, let the world know that I am taken, and some bitch has marked me like she owns me now. I am never going to stop, so you will have to live all hot and bothered always. If you are going to stay with me, because the only thing on my bucket list now is to have you with me like my bitch, and be your dog. Come get me baby. I want to fuck you on your main door. I want to push your face in the door, and spank your ass hard for being such an ass, and not fucking me soon everyday.

If you are going to stay with me, because the only thing on my bucket list now is to have you with me like my bitch, and be your dog. Come get me baby. I want to fuck you on your main door. I want to push your face in the door, and spank your ass hard for being such an ass, and not fucking me soon everyday.

**Erotica 10**.

She: You ain't gonna jerk off. You gonna be hard and upright, and throbbing and you won't be allowed to touch yourself at all. All hands away. No hands. 

He: You are going to undress me too when we meet. With your teeth. With sex friendly beats playing in the background. 

She: Just my mouth, teasing your head slowly with my tongue and just when you sigh and think this is it, pushing you completely and fully, deep into my mouth till you're at the back of my throat within that second. And I'm going to devour you. 

She: You're going to arch back in surprise and delight and hold my head into you and I'm going to dig my nails in the back of your thighs and push you deeper into my mouth, sucking and filling my mouth with all of you and holding firmly onto you with my lips wrapped around tight as you can think and my teeth just teasing you. 

She: And you'll then hold my hair, gather it, move it away from my face so you can see me looking at you. Deeply in your dark eyes and seeing only you, for you and nothing but you while I pull you out of my mouth, run my hands on your balls and firmly but softly at the same time cradle them and run your dick in and out of my tight lipped mouth dripping with every drop of you until you can stand anymore. 

He: Are you touching yourself right now? If not then circle that clit, run your fingers slowly as you keep typing to me. 

She: Till you want to collapse, and let me climb over you, and eat you up like I'm never going to get to. 

She: And while I cower over you, my tits are gonna touch your thighs, gently grazing them and you're gonna feel how hard they are with my hair all over your stomach and my mouth swallowing you in your entirety right back in and keep you there, in the grips of my wet and thirsty tight lipped mouth, while my hands, specifically my fingers find your balls and tease you by touching then ever so slightly and letting my tits graze them while I suck out every last drop you have for me. 

She: Until you start shaking and wanting more and I pullback and look at you with all the longing in my heart, and hold you back down, and finish you off by blowing you so hard that you cannot contain yourself and you explode in my mouth filling it up and forcing me to swallow all of what you've given me just so I can catch my breath. 

He: Why don't you come up and kiss every part of my skin!? 

She: Nope. Nothing but your dick and my mouth. Kisses are for another time.

She: So what's ur move? To get started in bed? Because with the way you speak, I know you have not one but a few moves that you start with.

He: I will start with your neck. Please don't turn me on right now. I am already all hot and bothered. I want to hold you. In a surprise, from your back. Kiss your neck, and bite it. Mark my territory, and slide my fingers done your waist. Keep them there, and bite your ears. Slowly watching you bite your lips. How about you?

She: I don't have a move. :P But I do. Well I would usually start by taking a sit with my legs around your waist kissing you slowly, and then deepen the kiss. Maybe softly bite the lip, and then pull your head back with my hand in your hair trailing kisses till your ear. Lick your earlobe and softly whisper... do you know what you have to do next? Or will I have to tell you?

He: You are fucking me. Because you won't survive the way I will toss you and throw you around in bed. This kind of teasing is making me want you. I am going to run my fingers all over you. Not ripping your clothes like I usually would. But peel layers of it, off you... Slowly. As slowly as time can run, while kissing you slowly. Actually, not a kiss but a peck. Only rubbing my lips on yours, then a nibble. A slow kiss on your upper lip. Stop. Freeze there, holding your lips in mine as my hands continue to undress you.

Yes. Un-dress you. Not torture nor punish nor tear you into bare nakedness. And let this silence of waiting for my next move eat away your patience. Then I slide my tongue to touch yours. Deep slow kisses. While my fingers are playing a symphony on your back. Running across it, in the most slow soft manner. Then run my tongue down your neck, collar bones, chest, boobs, and waist then whisper... Do you know where I am headed? Or do you want to lead?

She: Well if that happens I would pull you with your collar to the bed, push all of you in and show you how leading is not something you should be thinking about with me, unless I tell you to.

He: Then I will pull myself out and put my tulips on your organ to eat you out before you can blink.

She: Okay now you are turning me on which is not a good sign.

He: Well, I am going to make sure that you get addicted to me.

So it's an early morning. You wake up on bed and turned to hug me but find yourself alone on bed wearing just your underwear and bare body. You rush out of the bedroom to find me. And your eyes stops at the sight of me in the kitchen. Wearing your long sleeved white shirt from the last night.

Buttons randomly done exposing my bra strap on one side of my shoulder my hairs tied out in a messy pony tail. And I'm busy mixing something in bowl. And earphones in my ears. Moving on the beats and enjoying cooking. Couldn't hear you calling out for me.

So I walk to you, you hear me come, but you pretend to not have noticed me. I get close, real close, nibble your ear, and let my hard-on touch your ass. You smile and continue with the mixing. I slowly undo your shirt off your shoulder, and bite the bra strap. Slide my hand under the shirt on your back and hold your waist tightly.

I can feel your hair smell of shampoo, like a fresh woman for me to eat. I spank your ass, and turn you around. You slide the bowl away from us on the counter, and you sit on the top. So I pull your bra strap, and let it snap back to hit you. You jolt, and let me kiss you.

I press my lips against yours, rubbing it there for a second. Then slowly nibble your lower lip, till you draw your tongue out to enter my mouth. I bite your lip, and you gasp. I enjoy how both my hands are now inching slowly up your waist to your back. And running up your spine, to your neck and hold your neck to kiss you harder.

I could feel warm of your body as you coming closer. My hearts biting faster and anxious at the same time to feel your touch on my skin. As you nibble on my ears. I feel a shiver run across my skin and between my legs. I feel my knees going weak with the way you bite my bra strap.

Making my panties wet. And right when you grabed my waist damn I literally lost my breath. Finally catching my breath and trying to make it sound normal. I uttered in a low voice, "Umm! Ah! You are up so early?"
I pause for a second, slide my arms behind you, look for the hook, to undo it again. I slide it off your shoulder, and down your arms, gently caressing them, till the bra falls apart.

I pull your shirt away, as you gasp, "Oh! it will tear." So I cup your left tit in my palm, and touch the tip of my tongue to it. You run a chill down your spine. Hold my head clenching my hair for a while. So I move back, and slide down a finger, that tugs at your wet panties, and pull them away like I own you now.

I spread your legs slightly apart, and then go I down.

She: It is a quaint Sunday afternoon, 
A long while since I have sat and reflected. 
My sister sits in the next room,
Laughing on some random video. 
The occasional chirping of birds,
Is more clear these days. 
Oh gosh, how I have missed these voices.

He: or did you miss the sound of water
When you were staring at me in the bath
That splashing on that stone
That hid your thumping heart
From my lecherous moans?

She: Words can deceive, 
I agree. 
But let not emotions hide. 
Leave, let's go. 
And find ourselves wrapped in bedsheets
Late until the afternoon.

He: Where though?
I'm shut away by the powers that be
I can't help but wait for your teases
See if you mean
All those lists you want to do for me

Most of me think otherwise
Thinks of you as a thief of hearts
Dragging men by your flowing hair
Leaving them all in tears
On a mountainside

She: Ah! Won't that be nice? 
To steal hearts and make others cry
Instead of the one being 
Who always ends up crying 
Of us, let's not put so much thought into it.
Cause who knows what we would be by the end of it

He: How dare you to give me hope 
And snatch it all away in a poem
You are getting assaulted
The moment you land here
You will be kidnap-ped 
In the airport lounge
And made love to 
In the nearest cabin 
We find

She: I give you not thee 
The power to kidnap me
And fuck me in a cabin
Instead, show me around 
Take me to a cafe 
And then later 
Let's find a place 
And fuck for like ages

He: You are a seductress
Why? Would I trust you!
What? If you ghost me!
Runaway into an urban jungle?
Without leaving a clue!

She: People leave clues 
For where they can not find
You and I are bound 
And no matter where we are 
We always end up around

He: What's taking you long?
What plans are you hatching?
Is this a trap?
For you cannot disappear for years
Like the last time around
And leave me wanting
To burn all those calories
And all those electric touches
That I spent on all the wrong women
Wishing they had our exact spark

Well, I am going to hold you tight, 
Push you down harder
Slide my boner in
Till you choke
And then be as gentle as I can be
Until you don't want to let me go

She: Days have gone by hard and crude 
We both suffered and howled 
Calling me names 
And not trusting me now
Will only bring more pain
And I am done with that now

He: Like tie you up, blindfold you
Tease you for very long
Running my hands and lips
All over your body
Kissing you as a tease
Only a tease and nothing else
Until you beg me to eat you out

She: I will cry out your name
And the world will know 
That a passion is born

He: I hate this distance 
That lie between us
Between Doon and Bangalore
And now Noida and BOM
I want a wildfire running through your arms
When my fingers touch you,
Feel it all warming up

She: My vagina will flow and flow 
An endless volcano 
That makes you trip 
And me on your top
I will show you how it's done
So you know
I am a queen 
And who should get love!

He: You better move here this month
Because I can't take it anymore
My boner is all set to explode
At the same time as your volcano
And never gonna stop
Till you learn to count till 12
And trash talk to you
Until you feel mentally unwell

She: Distance makes the heart grow fonder
They say
Who knows, when we meet 
We may burn the earth down
Stop stop stop
I can't this anymore 
Come here 
Hold me tight 
And engulf me whole

He: Fuck what the world says
Fuck all other quotes
I want to move to you
Or have you move to me
The moment this quarantine goes
So don't you waste your time
Sitting around at home
Book your flight tickets
And come down to Bombay
We will find a place for you
And work on sharing the rent
Spend none on condoms
Only on stuff for our own creative studio
Or if Delhi is cheaper
Then move out of home
I will join you there
And we can rule the world
I doubt we will ever write
Except for our own personal erotica
And all those moans that will echo
Might as well sell background score for sex 
I so want to get a kennel though
For a million more dogs
So I can see you be happy 
Whenever I am not around
Tease me with pictures
Tease me now
Tease me when you aren't orgasming
To my keyboard, and sounds

She: You want me to tie you down and run my lips all over your skin?
Like you own me? 

He: Without letting me touch you? 
Hold you? 
Or feel you grind gently? 
Go slow! 
Until it's obvious that you want me harder than ever 
No matter where we are

She: And without letting you see me
And then go down on you
Without touching you at all

He: How good are you?
How long can you last?
Haven't you any idea?
Because you move like a pro
Though I know you are no match for my cock

She: I'm pretty sure that's true

He: Well, I am going to hold you tight, 
Push you down harder
Slide my boner in
Till you choke
And then be as gentle as I can be
Until you don't want to let me go

She: I definitely don't want to let you go!
Gentle?

He: Because you won't last the minute
The minute I unleash the monster inside me
You will crumble like breadsticks
Dipped in mayonnaise and cream

How about I surprise you, 
Sneak up to you, 
When you are just out of your bath
Have you scared, 
But when you turn around, 
You go, "Ah! It's you!"

Then I take you to the nearest wall, 
Pin you gently, 
And see you run your arms around my back, 
Push you on it harder, 
As your nipples harden up. 

Then I give you a kiss, 
As slow as they can get, 
Just place my lips on yours, 
And do nothing more yet. 

Then I cup your face is both my palms, 
And nibble on that upper lip, 
Then bit the lower one, 
To stay there kissing, 
While our hands run a different story. 

I turn you around, 
Push you face forward into that wall, 
Place my boner on your ass, 
And slip off one bra strap. 

Then slowly run my hands to your nipple, 
And circle it slowly, 
I won't stop with it, 
Until you scream and moan, 
Until you push me back on the bed. 

So I take off your tops, 
And pin one of your arms, 
Up.

Then run my tongue from the bottom of your back, 
All the way, 
Up to your mane. 

Then bite your back, 
And mark my territory, 
Just like dogs would do. 

Slide my hand, 
Down, 
And circle that clit, 
Until you beg me to stop. 

But you want to, 
Feel my boner slither, 
Mm by mm, 
Inside you, softly. 

As your moans, 
Grow louder, 
You turn your cheek, 
To kiss me on my lips.

**Essentialism**.

The idea is to lose yourself in nature, and find the time to nurture your creative pursuits. Emptying the hard-drive. Publishing all the work we have done for a decade on the website. Six is so-so. Last year I was on 20.

I was dead sleepy tired on the last day of the year. So much so that I could not help but sleep all the way through my birthday, and the eve, right until 9am of January 1st. That’s me being a lot lazy. That’s 48 hours mostly at a stretch. I promised myself that I would not work another day into my 26th year.

I have been bootstrapping all my ventures so far. A few things made me realise that a shift into the economic perspective of things is apparent. My team desires so, and they are correct with the effort they put into these projects. I was contacted by Prestashop about their amazing Ecommerce product. This got me thinking about using Ecommerce to fund housing.

We are not keen on becoming a marketplace but the idea seems lucrative. It might help me get some maker friends do more good work. Prestashop might save us from the hassles of funding / crowdfunding / dealing with a lot of back, and forth mailers / client projects / et cetera. This idea is to pursue essentialism. Stay in our niche of WikiHouse, and develop the platform.

But then again we are all creators. Ideas come, and go like the tide. It is often very hard to decide what we should not pursue. There might be a lot to process before we have a standard operating protocol. Besides all of that I love writing.

Maybe a book or two shall help me present our work here to the vast outside world. Getting about 2000+ reads on Medium is quite a morale boost for someone who is in the habit of emptying his mind on every opportunity he seeks. I have been asked to write, to photograph, and to create art. Some of us believe that these are some of the things I do well. But then being an essentialist, and having a basic need for variety in life doesn’t always run in sync.

With a lot of things popping up, and sleeplessness being the theme of the decade, I think I might as well shoot for us collaborating with others on a massive scale. It is in knowing that being self reliant when it comes to funding shall not only enable us to anticipate our options. But now because you have the money, asking questions like, “Do you want a house for free?” comes natural, and easy to deliver. Architects can have a bigger social impact that any other trade around the world. After all that’s the 101 of architecture — to use your intelligence to make this world a better place.

That’s me being a lot lazy. That’s 48 hours mostly at a stretch. I promised myself that I would not work another day into my 26th year.

I have been bootstrapping all my ventures so far. A few things made me realise that a shift into the economic perspective of things is apparent. My team desires so, and they are correct with the effort they put into these projects. I was contacted by Prestashop about their amazing Ecommerce product. This got me thinking about using Ecommerce to fund housing.

We are not keen on becoming a marketplace but the idea seems lucrative. It might help me get some maker friends do more good work. Prestashop might save us from the hassles of funding / crowdfunding / dealing with a lot of back, and forth mailers / client projects / et cetera. This idea is to pursue essentialism. Stay in our niche of WikiHouse, and develop the platform.

But then again we are all creators. Ideas come, and go like the tide. It is often very hard to decide what we should not pursue. There might be a lot to process before we have a standard operating protocol. Besides all of that I love writing.

Maybe a book or two shall help me present our work here to the vast outside world. Getting about 2000+ reads on Medium is quite a morale boost for someone who is in the habit of emptying his mind on every opportunity he seeks. I have been asked to write, to photograph, and to create art. Some of us believe that these are some of the things I do well. But then being an essentialist, and having a basic need for variety in life doesn’t always run in sync.

With a lot of things popping up, and sleeplessness being the theme of the decade, I think I might as well shoot for us collaborating with others on a massive scale. It is in knowing that being self reliant when it comes to funding shall not only enable us to anticipate our options. But now because you have the money, asking questions like, “Do you want a house for free?” comes natural, and easy to deliver. Architects can have a bigger social impact that any other trade around the world. After all that’s the 101 of architecture — to use your intelligence to make this world a better place.

5 becomes 20, 20 becomes an age, age I spend with wonder, wonder that shall we ever remain the same, same as our fantasies, fantasies of lust, lust for a love, love for each other. Other day another time, time for a company, company of her, her thoughts plunder, plunder my restless soul.

“Just for one last time, we will try to shoot at where our hearts lie, as we have run from end to end, of calendars on techno-bend, deserted as we may feel, in a decade long of ignorance, until New Year’s Eve, we shall play, or cherish these memories, for eternity.”
