**Anthologie - Type P**.

**Paid**.

This year I got paid for; Airbnb, Architecture, Art, Bookmaking, Clothing, Data curation, Film making, Furniture, Manufacturing, Photography, Songwriting, Startups, Vocals, and WikiHouses. So, dabble in things, that might make sense to your innate being. Don’t bother about what the world thinks, because everytime I told them say, that I was doing this new thing, they had their own version of criticism or marketing. So trust your heart blindly, and teach your brain to do so. Because the brain is a database you see, that’s trained to get you the correct answer on its first thought, which again always comes from the heart. All the best, and have faith.

**Pass**.

Like the tree in the snow,
I wonder if we know,
Of what pain lies,
In these distant meadows.

I lost some range,
Of technology in a train,
With no connection to save,
I feel estranged.

But worry you not,
In the next lot,
Of the time that comes,
Even this will pass.

**Passion**.

It feels almost like I have lost the passion to do something for others. As if everytime I think of solving a problem for creating a product or just sharing information and knowledge that might help someone achieve something in ways unforeseen, I get lazy, hopeless, and lost. I don't know why I have been feeling this way lately but it maybe because I have tried too hard in the past to make the world a better place. Everything I have tried has not worked out, well not everything most of the things. And it is getting harder by the day to be able to find something that brings me joy even by the thought of it.

I would want to be excited because my work is rewarding. Nothing else matters except doing what makes me feel alive.

**Peer pressure**.

I don't know if you have noticed but you know we can do a lot more if we complicate things. I lost this thought but I am trying to remember it from a glimpse. I was looking at this web development course n Coursera, thinking of all the things you can do if you learn web development. You can be a true minimalist because you won't need any social media accounts to store your own data. Having said that, when I look at Paul Graham's website, it is minimalistic by design, but the content is heavy.

Not the words, but the depth in them. He talks of computers, mathematics, programming, and things like that. I have a simple website, too. But I don't possess that depth of knowledge. So I talk of simpler things.

Obviously, Paul is at the top of your game, I am not. Maybe at times, instead of trying to keep things simple, we should describe things in the utmost complicated manner, since adding depth to anything has been most beneficial to society at large. This reasons how people with messy desk-space may be smarter than those with OCDs, neatly organized desk-space. We do not know for sure, at least I don't. Anyway, the former dons complexity while the latter, simplicity.

It is often been said that 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication'. This reasons how people with OCDs, neatly organized desk-space are smarter than those with messy desk-space. Now if you can imagine, I think the trick lies in the transition: from being the person with OCD to accepting that the messy table is organized in its own ways. The ability to stay complicated or simple, but to accept that there is a sense in either. This acceptance is how you have a better chance of winning than your peers.

**People**.

I find it rather interesting how the Indian government has now made the train routes go from all the states to the central region that is the national capital region of Delhi. For for most people it just seems that they running trains but what I see is that it's a very small ploy to inspect and measure the infection of covid19 in India. More than being logistic kal decision I think that when you get of the train at Delhi they will by routine for the thermometer to your forehead and check the temperature. This one action is basically the centralisation of monitoring the spread of this infection. To be honest I think it is a smart move.

It may not be better than what I thought would be ideal to do that is sending teams to every household like when you host a census. Although you may think that asking lives of all the people in these teams, but the current approach taken by the Indian government risks the life of not just person holding that thermometer but the lives of everybody on the trains. In a very ratio and proportional perspective, you are putting a lot at stake as a government when you mobilise the same people that you have current time for over a period of 60 days without doing any accurate testing to differentiate the carriers of the virus versus the people who are infected and are facing the symptoms versus the people who are completely removed from this population.

**Phew**.

I just had the scariest leak of my life.
Off a bridge on Palm beach road,
next to the ONGC pipeline.

Peed into a three storeyed drop,
while standing on wobbling sidewalk stones,
with nothing to hold on to.

And heights make me dizzy af.
Phew!

**Photograph**.

A photograph is like a memory. a part of the picture with a whole story unseen behind the frame. a story, of emotions, of people, of feelings. a story which only the photographer can imagine. a story which only he can narrate.

A story which he alone can truly feel, truly fall for, truly be a part of. experience. one such story that comes to my mind everytime I see this photograph hanging on the wall in my uncle’s living room. It is a bunch of lillies. White, and divine like the place it belongs to.

Kerala. God’s own country they say. with dark brown wood holding them, they shine. they seem to take you into the photograph so that you can imagine the scenes, the people, the identity behind the frame. you can truly go ahead, and know more about the people there.

The family was a large one but the feelings they shared, and the connection they kept, warm like the closely knit woollen fabric we know.

**Play**.

Play "Will this work for you?"

It's a game where we,
1. Take turns to share our ideas for our relationship.
2. Take turns to check if the ideas are mutual.
3. Leave everything that isn't mutual out of the picture.
4. Choose each other over ideas... because duh!

We are real, ideas are imaginary.

**Po**.

Unnaku enge ponam po,  
Anna yen kitte kalyanam pannam po.

**Podcast**.

I tried walking, and recording a podcast on <a href="https://anchor.fm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anchor.fm</a> today. I did this instead of my daily 4AM hour reading. The idea seems interesting, but there are hurdles, and glitches. The biggest hurdle would probably be people in vehicles asking for directions. They break your flow of thought.

It would I am guessing take practice to find relevant pointers to create impromptu content if you are stalled mid-way. To add to that, the app has amazing, and sensitive sound reception which does not differentiate between human voice, and surrounding sounds. The glitches would be the 20 min segment that I recorded as a part to my hour long episode is stuck at “uploading to library”. Although the prelude got saved just fine. Maybe I should try doing 5 min segments.

The other glitch was that the app does not record, or store segments if you think of reading written notes from another app such as Google Keep. The recording disappears, and you land up on Anchor’s home screen. I lost about 15 min of content here. The app has a beautiful gallery of SFX, sounds, and music to use as Interlude, or background scores to your recordings. Almost to extent where you can create pure music mixes in anchor.

It’s fun how this helps if you are looking for more than just soundboarding to yourself. Anchor’s place the phone on your ears to record helps keep away insane attention from the insanity that you are doing. Maybe starting small makes more sense at my scale. Due to sheer lack of knowledge when it comes to editing audio. This bit might need strategies to create a better, and clearer episode.

One of which I think would be to record pointers in the comfort of your own room.

**Point**.

I hit a point in my life, when I realized that there were fewer days ahead of me than there were behind me. So every single day ahead is the best day of my life.

**Portraits**.

So I have always been thinking about making a blog for the way my hair grows back. Self shot portraits, day after day, documenting how my look changes to an extent that I get stopped at ID checks because the photo doesn’t look anything like me. I have had my doubts on how the world would take it. The judgements passed, and why am I doing this. As if my inner self criticized me for validation of some sort.

But then again the whole process shall free me of my qualms and queries. It will make me free as I throw an vulnerable side of me into debate on purpose. The swarm of people that I come into contact with on social media, and then that knowledge being a reminder that public opinion does not matter. Fit me as I am. Take me as I am.

For I have years of experience walking into difficult situations knowingly. The idea that I have to prove something will vanish. And I will be freed of all self doubt that sets in when I am questioned for my radical uncommon actions, or behaviours. The self awareness that this brings is more important as an asset to have than any other life experience can bring. This blog is @madewithadobe.
