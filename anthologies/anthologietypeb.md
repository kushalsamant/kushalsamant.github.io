**Anthologie - Type B**.

**Background music**.

There is this constant background music that comes to us in life. Most of it is the form of other people talking at us or other things around us that create sound or noise depending on the way you look at it. It is hard to pretend that these things do not bother us at work but the better way of doing things might be to say no. It is okay to ask for space. It is okay to ask for time.

It is okay to be patient. It is okay to slow down. No matter that we try, in this life we should all believe in that story. The story which is probably the first story that you heard about. The story about the tortoise and the hare.

The tortoise wins doesn't he/she? Well that my friends, is true even in life. Like one of my architects used to say, the slower you go, the longer things will last. Her rule applies even in everything. From dating to products. Everywhere.

**Balloons & bubbles**.

How do you change the name of a city? — You start with the local bus pass. Let’s be clear about this notion that what you see, and what you get are often not the best of what we will see happening in life. Most things revolve around to land nowhere. That, in fact, is a good thing. You can choose to bounce around in ecstatic motion for a certain number of years, only to have learned, grown, and prima facie, evolved. Evolution is the sole purpose of life. It is not progress, but paradigm shifts that challenge dogma, and act as catalysts to any decision making to the extent of being subconscious. If our lives are an one time event, we might as well be vulnerable, and prick ourselves, only to fly around the room like a balloon.

**Bathroom door**.

I opened the bathroom door, wondering what will my friends think about me if they discovered that one of the sober guys was doing it too. I mean getting more, and more involved in the whole prospect of the smoke.

The other thought on my mind was, why do I always do things, say stuff, and act with the only question in my mind being: “what will they think of me?”

Well that day, when I entered the bath, the only thing on my mind was “I want to smoke three cigarettes”.

The mirror right in front of me, beckoned me to come talk to it. Do the same stuff, some power crazy, depressed maniac would does in the movies. Pep talk.

But the second thought scared the shit out of me, when I could imagine it becoming a habit, and being able to let go of the habit.

Letting Go. It brought me immediately next to my girl. Facing her, contemplating whether she might want to come back or I should give up the fight.

Some voices outside brought me snapping back to reality. I looked at the toilet window, doing the math, which part of it should I close. My actions protecting the knowledge that my friend smokes; after all, it was his bathroom, his house, his mercy. I was a nobody. I had nothing.

And for the first time in my life, I had nothing to lose as consequence of my actions. It felt sinister. It felt terrible.

With my mind busy travelling a bizarre train of thought processes, my hand was busy trying out different combinations of letting the air out through the window.

I got tired of the whole thing, and sat down on the sink, with my back to the mirror. The garden outside, still visible. The voices, still very much audible. I could see the window pane, the steel frame, green grass, the blank wall, the bright sunshine, and the things in my mind!

**Being supportive**.

What do you do if you travel to another city to spend time with your partner because she/he is sad. And she/he pushes you away, then asks you to wait for her/his birthday, and spend her/his birthday evening by going out with some other guy friend/girl friend who asked her/him for dinner at 8pm, and then say it's just drinks, and then come after dinner to do a small dinner post 10pm with you where he/she drops her/him and then your partner tells her/his friends that it was dinner, and you feel terribly sidelined? 

What would you do?

**Being torn**.

Between a job or your own shop,
Between money or that desire to hop,
Even if it means that you might pretty much flop,
Between being debt free, and poverty a top,
Between a cage, and freedom of thoughts,
Between what Jim Carrey said about his father,
And what mom screams to you a lot,
Between security, and your dreams of years,
I am lost at making a decision dear,
Between selling my craft, and saving my soul,
Between things that might last, and a risky endeavour.

**Being you**.

Life gives you exactly what you want. Have you ever noticed that ‘The Secret’ says: “Focus on what you want to happen. That’s all.” This means that if I were to focus on the kicker over, and over again, I would get exactly what I don’t want.

But there again we are all sly in our own crooked ways. Have you ever realized that ‘what you don’t want’ is also a conscious choice? Knowing this, what if we try applying this bit of information? If I choose to not want happiness, then I will have an abundance of it. So why not? Why not choose to not want happiness, and live a life of content? The catch here is that I do not mean to choose ‘unhappiness’, ‘sorrow’, ‘I just don’t want to be happy’ — I just don’t want happiness. That specific. Happiness is temporary like everything else. Feeling content has permanence. You might lose everything in the process, but then you get to be as sly as the our politicians — in ways life be surprised, — be on the list of people the universe learns her tricks from, — you will realize what really matters, and who really stays. Do you see how until November 8th, there was this fairy tale like charm to the beginnings of the world. Post November 8th, there is an attitude of facing life situations with a harsh reality, not fantasy. You will be left with a choice of being sad, and grim OR you could look at these bright side of happenings, and life-could-be-a-dream.

So then there are two sides to this coin. This might seem like the easy way, but then it is more of pretending that you don’t want something but liking it anyway when it comes to you. It is hard to keep doing this forever. You cannot lie to yourself and live with the fear that your thoughts affect your universe.

First of all, you don’t have a universe. You have a bubble. We are all too small to make a lasting impact on the universe. Even a humpback whale is too small for the vast deep ocean. So even if the universe is helping you out, my guess is because no matter how big you are, you are still that whale.

Secondly, no matter what happens or how anything makes you feel, life is just randomness at play — Just like this post and you are way better being true to yourself. Editing eats away a part of you. Be it writing, life or truth. “From a Mumbaikar’s perspective, American influence on his life just went from having a sense of Bandra to the menace of Harbour Line.”

**Break**.

Well I am thinking of taking a break from life, carrying the action camera i bought two years ago, and travelling through this country. vlog my way to travel. because somewhere i feel like: if i don't start living my daream life, then life might end before I begin.

**Breeze**.

The most fun things to do, is to get up in the morning, and keep running. I have never found myself to be so lazy in my entire life until this quarantine. So far it has been quite an experience. well if you look at it I have barely been able to monetize most of the things that I have been working on but now many doors are opening up. Everything that I had worked on over the past 10 or 15 years have suddenly been a sought-after skill set that everyone wants to have but they have not put in the effort so they have no option but to hire someone like me.

So all those years of learning and curiosity will now start to pay up. Which is very interesting to me because I never thought that this day would come. Almost everything from architecture to web design to venture capitalism 2 you just going out there and doing thanks has been the key for myself. Life is now breeze because I don't have to do a 9 to 5 job. Instead I can do a lot more monetarily by picking up these projects.

Projects that are basically me trying to help other people solve their problems.

**Brida 1**.

I wish there was a way to say or see the things that you are as I trod my favourite curve or see you limp on a path. There is so much for you to be so much for my words fall short but in you I see an angel in you I see a star as broken, and bruised you might be on you I see no scar. I see a glow that’s tender, innocent of the world afar, I see a joy so blissful, that my heart melts apart, and alone lies your blank stare that stops me in my tracks, and shows me how I blunder a search that I need not start.

**Brida 2**.

I told you I am a filler but I have never told anyone what I think about myself, and to me it just means that I am stressed. And these thoughts are leaking in fragments, and I am telling them to you because I have never taken any one to theatre or a dining out too.

Hell I have had many dates many more than men can count but to you I can pour my heart out. Hell I have had women ready with makeup, and all in the same room as me but I canned on them still such guts I have held but it all vanished when you were around.

I have always felt like a filler some friends said it’s nothing but emotional baggage, and I have tried but in vain. I know cures to most things that trouble a human heart but an answer to this I cannot tell.

I wished to see you romantically of course but then you are just 18 I am almost a decade older, and you wanted a friend. So I am trying to tell myself that I cannot do to you what I am looking for myself for ages since.

I want a person just a person to crash but it’s a lot of emotional baggage attached. I have tried my best to keep this within me but the idea that scares me is that of regrets again.

Of not telling you this, and parting away, and never know what it might be if things work a bit differently ages hence. I am so confused though my face doesn’t show I cannot see beyond you anymore.

Most of my answers for life lie elsewhere but the thought of your absence pain me so much more. I am trying to hide it under the cloak of being friends, and I wish I can keep it that way but the pain hurts me to a point of numbness.

I know we work together, and you have these rules I am praying that the next few weeks will be gentler to me. I wanted to tell you, all of this tomorrow but I was losing too many people, and beautiful lines than my mind can remember to share.

So I am writing this down I am sorry again I wish you would understand I just want you to decide for us over my numb selfish mind doing the honours instead. I just want to be happy with what makes you stay for the idea of losing a friend hurts. It hurts beyond repair.

For I have helped a million people in ways different but none of them have valued it, and thrown me away. I don’t seek attention maybe acceptance is the word but I don’t want to cry for it like this week again.

It’s been so good of her to trust me with her shop, and her store but I don’t see what lies ahead. I am just so lost in an endless mystery but when it comes to the future I cannot see, anymore.

**Bullets**.

He shouted, “No Bro, Wait!” As he could see his silhouette disappear into the dim space. Just a street lamp to decorate the street. Make it look like an alley. He wanted to run into it, and feel alive.

The panic in his heart set him free, froze his body as another chilled wind made him pause. To take it all in, and observe that pause, and capture the memory like a photograph before it faded away in the myriad of his neurons. He had too much to think, too much to sort through, and the anxiety was not helping him at all. Not a friend or a foe came to help him in his disruptive times. He was there for everyone meeting people, and finding friends again after 15 long years.

But there he was all alone lonely when they put bullets into his heart.

**Bumble**.

Well I matched with a girl on @bumble. She asked me out for the marine drive date. It was her idea entirely. So I went. This was a dating app date. Which she refused to call as a date. I met her for the first time. It was her first date on bumble. Second day on the app. In the middle of the night, she said she was sleepy, I am booking a cab back home.

She said she is feeling dizzy. So I offered her water. Then she said she won’t drink water. Then she said she doesn’t like walking. Then she said she wants to go use a washroom. So I took her to Intercontinental to use their restaurant rest room. Then on the way there she said she is on her second day of her periods. Which I honestly don’t know whether to believe or not. Her argument was that she was uncomfortable because of the periods. So it was right on her part to leave midway.

Which is okay I guess. But planning an all nighter during your periods is a no go na. So I agreed when she said she wants to book a cab and leave for home. So I was left with nothing to do but wait it out at marine drive for 5 hours. So I hitched a ride in her cab to Andheri because I knew I would get smokes and tea there. I bought smokes. I had a cup of tea and the cops drove this cyclewala away. I hate such women. When they quit on their own plans after its made clear that something like this will leave me stuck in the middle of the night. Half of me is angry on myself for taking a chance on someone planning an all nighter at marine drive again.

I will probably never take a chance on anyone again. That night was so Deja Vu. I wish I had a better judgement of people after all the people I have met. I am now going to run my red flags for people without any leniency. I will probably sell my books on Instagram.

She reconnected in 2020, and she confessed that she had lied about being on her chums. We decided to date but she quit that chapter because I did not apply for a government job.
