**Anthologie Type - I**.

**Ideas**.

Never found that everytime I get my Idea or everytime you come across an idea you will often think that you had thought about it sometime back in your life. But since you never picked it up or run with it, you were not the one who made it happen. Ideas come and go and they happen to find us in our life just like a dream becomes a reality. Now someone else might be the reason why we see them in our reality. It might be somebody else's effort.

It might be somebody else's money. It might be your brainchild. But it is not yours alone. So next time you feel that why were you not the person to make something happen, or the next time you feel that oh! shit I had thought about this first. So remember this, next time an idea comes to you, forget everything else and try it out.

**If**.

“If you’re not good enough,
you probably aren’t close enough.”

**I met someone**.

“You will meet her in seven days,
her name starts with N,
it has eight alphabets,
you will meet at the place you sang,
but hang on a sec,
don’t kiss her yet,
or you might lose her forever again.”

"Someone told me that,
nearly 10 years ago,
on an online crazy chat streak,
as crazy as this weekend was until now."

"So close to reality,
so hard to believe,
what someone saw in my past,
was my future behold! This week."

"I have never followed occult,
for all its mystery,
it has always been,
a double check for me.

She wants to be an conceptual artist,
and explore her beliefs,
in time travel, and philosophy,
while she is a soul to die for, indeed."

"When I look back on my life now,
connecting these dots seem so obvious to me,
everything fits so lovely,
even every silly thing I reaped.

Life could not have taught me better,
through sadness, and ease,
what joy was there to sit by her,
that the moment felt like eternity."

"I might sound so patronizing,
so head over heels,
being used to empty dinner tables,
and empty cafes it seems."

"I love to be outdoors,
away from those haunting patterns, and fear,
but with her this was different,
no odd design could bother me."

"I have never felt so careless,
I have never felt so free,
the design never did haunt me,
honestly."

"Mad over donuts,
and sweet chariot maybe,
have never been my options,
for dates or dining out,
lately."

"I was shivering from the cold,
so she sat me down on a bench,
and shared her love for purple,
oh baigan you see!"

"I wore that jacket to walks,
from cafes to streets,
swaggin’ around town,
while blind she be of me."

"My friends,
oh cry! they will, “the man ain’t my friend”,
for traveling to meet her,
to dine in maybe,
deny they know me."

"For such a beauty is my lady,
beyond the strokes of my pencil,
cannot capture her in sharp portraits,
or anatomy."

"Yet she echoes through my soul,
like magic in her fingertips,
like the poetry in thee,
coz’ yes, we did not kiss."

**India**.

I live in a country,  
where if a soldier is shot,  
my countrymen fight,  
against each other,  
about should they go to war,  
rather than fighting with those,  
who shot that brave soldier.

**Influence**.

In my past, I was fired in situations as people vied for influence. I have been shown how important, this power over someone or something can be. Our world is shaped by influence. Free Will is an illusion. Some people are true bred consumerists for the reason that the market influences their own judgement to an extent that they consider their entire lives to be a product of free will.

A close friend once told me that I was influenceable. That means you can influence me with ease. At that age, I found that reality bothersome. There was a need to control actions. A need to demonstrate control over life.

Now however, I realise that we are humans. Humans, by default, are influenceable. This sure is vulnerable. This, like any other vulnerability, is powerful. The power lies in knowing what influences you.

Once you know what does, and how it does, you have won half the battle. The other half lies in catching yourself. The more number of things that you can find to have an influence over you, the more power you will have. The ideas of fashion, beauty, and make-up are prevalent for a sole reason that these ideas are projected as a necessary element in human life in advertising. Popular media holds a large influence on human lives.

Mostly for the reason that it is popular. I find that toxic. As you grow older, popularity recedes into the shaded patch down the memory lane. The things that influence you change. Your interests, hobbies, and decisions, are based on ideas that are not your own.

If you are not careful, influence can suck you into living a life that you never really wished for. Self awareness is the antidote. Wish for wishes that make you burn as an individual. Wishes that make you rise up from those ashes like a Phoenix.

**Inner peace**.

To find inner peace, all it takes is to keep reminding yourself about it. To make it the epitome of the choices you make. To remember to not lose yourself in the past, in a train of thoughts. To remember to not lose yourself in the future, in another train of thoughts. There maybe only so much that keeps you from living in the present, and to pause before you take any action.

To pause not to decide your next move, but to choose to stop instead. If ever there is anything that you would need to do, then it is only going to be something you would absolutely love to. There are no ifs, and buts, just the same as there is no better. You are no better than anyone in just the same way you are no less than anyone either. The only thing you have to remember is to not remember at all.

The secret lies in forgetting. To rid of all habit. And to look out into space, not the skies. To see what you is happening around you. And to know that it will change.

To wait, and observe instead of taking action. When you focus only on the things around you, will you understand what you are here for.

**Inside**.

Because they are not straight the nosing is off but you were taught here, and you don’t know a lot but since we all have been to such a place. Hopefully we try to escape every other terrain jot down our thoughts on drawings instead. This is not my poem but people don’t wait they don’t know what was destined for every other thread. You can rant along but this is not a rant this is realising that in the end the only way that you will find answers is to look inside.

**Instagram**.

Did something happen to Instagram?
Or is it just me?
Everyone be decluttering
Peer pressure maybe.

**Instagram strategy**.

I have always looked at Instagram as a note taking app more than a photo sharing app. Most people do not use all the features of any platform, in the same way as they do not use all the features of their smartphones. The thing - although I don't agree with the idea - seems similar to that of leveraging excess capacity like Uber, Airbnb, blah blah. Now you know I am lazy so I prepared this strategy for Instagram to be my chosen platform for content creation instead of content publishing because who will use 5 RCs for the same TV, right?

Here's what I think.

**Level 1 - Creating book content**.

Instagram's caption space has 2000 chars in one post = that's almost 1.25 page.

I intend to use these page/s to make book/s.

If you fill in complete captions for about 200 posts = then you would have written an equal of 300 pages = that's 1 book.

You will find the process taxing because it is strenuous to write about the same topic 200 times in a row. Hence to make this lazier, I recommend using hashtags for example #akshaycoffee, #akshaythis, #akshaythat, #akshayxyz.

The advantages here are:
- This way people can track your content about specific topics.
- You can write about different topics 200 times in a row.
- You can tap on any of your hashtags and keep track of your progress.
- You can see the Top/Recent posts in any hashtag.

I view this as a tool to get your peers and society-at-large to review your content. You can use a desktop browser to copy all the captions under any hashtag to Google documents. This document can be exported to become an eBook in .epub/.pdf/.any-other-file-format-you-fancy.

**Level 2 - Creating lectures content**.

I intend to use these book/s as content to give one-hour-long-lecture/s on any topic with/without fumbling. I can use 1 book as enough content to give a 1 one-hour-long-lecture on any topic with fumbling. I can use 2 books as enough content to give a 1 one-hour-long-lecture on any topic without fumbling. I can use 4 books as enough content to give a 2 one-hour-long-lecture on any topic without fumbling, and so on.

Some friends believe they can use 1 book as enough content to give 4 one-hour-long-lectures without fumbling. This is subjective. You do you. Oh! You can also upload this to YouTube.

**Level 3 - Creating Vit. M**.

If you fill in complete captions for about 200 posts = then you would have written an equal of 300 pages = that's 1 book = enough content for 1 one-hour-long-lecture with fumbling.

You can go to any cafe/venue and ask for a spot to do a paid one-hour-long guest lecture using this book as leverage. A venue will ask you for a profit share OR ask you to pay a lumpsum amount as rent. A venue lecture for 50 participants at INR 250/participant may raise about INR 12,500 for an hour of work.

If you fill in complete captions for about 400 posts = then you would have written an equal of 600 pages = that's 2 books = enough content for 1 one-hour-long-lecture without fumbling.

You can go to any college/university and ask for a spot to do a paid one-hour-long guest lecture using these books as leverage. A university will not ask you for a profit share. A university lecture for 300 participants at INR 100/participant may raise about INR 30,000 for an hour of work.

**Level 4 - Creating workshop content**.

If you fill in complete captions for about 800 posts = then you would have written an equal of 1200 pages = that's 4 books = enough content for 2 one-hour-long-lectures without fumbling.

You can go to any cafe/venue and ask for a spot to do a paid six-hour-long workshop using these books as leverage. A venue will ask you for a profit share OR ask you to pay a lumpsum amount as rent.

The workshop format in reverse order:

> [ 05 PM - Last Lecture - 04 PM - Exercise review - 03 PM - Exercise in progress - 02 PM - Lunch - 01 PM - Exercise briefing - 12 PM - First Lecture - 11 AM ]

- 11 AM - 12 PM - First Lecture
- 12 PM - 01 PM - Exercise briefing
- 01 PM - 02 PM - Lunch
- 02 PM - 03 PM - Exercise in progress
- 03 PM - 04 PM - Exercise review
- 04 PM - 05 PM - Last Lecture

The workshop format in regular order:

> [ 11 AM - First Lecture - 12 PM - Exercise briefing - 01 PM- Lunch - 02 PM - Exercise in progress - 03 PM - Exercise review - 04 PM - Last Lecture - 05 PM ]

This format means you will be talking at the group from 11am-12pm and 4pm-5pm. This format means you will be talking to the group from 12pm-1pm and 3pm-4pm. This format means you will be doing nothing from 1pm-2pm and 2pm-3pm. A workshop for 10 participants at INR 10000/participant may raise about INR 100,000 for 4 hours of work. You can charge more depending upon the exercise/s that you can create for your particular topic/s.

Bear in mind that:
- Every exercise should give the participant/s an item to take home OR something to show his/her/their friends and family.
- This item/something should be a tangible product i.e., it should not be a certificate.
- You can do individual exercises, team exercises, whole-class exercises.
- You can split this hour into as many permutation and combination/s of these exercises.
- You get 6 mins/participant to review their work on a one-on-one basis, so ideally create one amazing exercise only.
- You get 60 mins to complete all exercises, use it wisely.

**Fin**.

I mean these books, lectures, and workshops are what Instagram captions can lead to, understood?

**Intelligently**.

> “If we share, everyone can have enough.”

We believe that every society has enough to feed itself. Everyone will cherish what they create by sharing. The common man’s contributions through the internet will override all existing means of thinking. GRÜHAM is a “build” event series that builds shelter to meet the needs of a community. We build a WikiHouse because of the community building that comes out through the process.

All our data is freely shared on GitHub. You can fork it, and give back something more to our world. Doing more “build” events will meet the needs of our civilization. The sharing economy will become powerful enough to end most of what pandora’s box had led into our world. Now you can be a part of this movement too.

We may not change the world, yet let's begin here.

> “Contribution changes, not the life of one individual,  
> but part of your life too, May be our planet.”

**I won't let you walk away, with a broken heart**.

I won’t let you walk away, with a broken heart,
And I wanna ride away from the past,
I wanna kiss your tears good bye coz’ I love you.

If you need to know what I will do,
Try asking once, and it comes true,
You don’t need to cry my baby, I love you.

On a rainy, rainy, rainy, rainy, rainy,
On a rainy day you wished,
To kiss me on my lips,
And I know what you mean by it too.

We will be together for evers,
For a daughter like Chanelle, and you know,
I hope you remember them, don’t you?

Wanna roam these beaches of Goa,
With the big sun shining down on us,
I can’t take my eyes off this beautiful you.

And I’m sorry for the things I did,
Hurt ur heart, my devil;
With our love so true, I know its glue.

And I wish to pour it on you,
And stick to you,
Just the way we did every afternoons.

I am gonna be yours forever,
Even if you take me dear,
I love you, you love me, & we love us two.
