**Anthologie - Type Y**.

**Yawn**.

Yawn
whispered a wind
in my ear
breathing fire
till it disappears
How beautiful are you
like frozen gold
as music bellows by a rising yawn.

Yawn.

Yawn whispered a wind in my ear breathing fire till it disappears How beautiful are you like frozen gold as music bellows by a rising yawn.

**Yesterday**.

Yesterday, at about 9pm, the security said he was closing the place for the day. He said, “Light bandh karke aana, hum niche rahenge darwaze pe.” So I took an hour to pack all calls up. It was pouring. At the gates I asked him, “Ap darwaze pe hi the, itni barish mein?” We were sitting out on a porch at The Hive, there was absolutely no one there. Empty like a haunted mansion, drenched in the rains, deserted by its community, stood the mansion on its edge. As music barreled at its walls, trumpets, drums, and all. As a Navratri procession passed the gates, I waited for the rains to subside before I could make a move back home. He replied, “Humein ye kam pasand hai! In logon ko dekhna pasand hai”.

**Ye toh tu jaane na**.

Ye toh tu jaane na
tu ye pehchane na

koi kaise
koi kaise

Yaaron ke faasle
faaslon se pyaare

ude aise
ude aise

Ke jahan mein
na toh koi

dekh paye
jo hai zaroori

Ye toh tu jaane na
tu ye pehchane na

koi kaise
koi kaise

Yaaron ke faasle
faaslon se pyaare

ude aise
ude aise

Kahi tune
jo ye jaana

reh jaye
ye zamaana

Tere piche
Tere piche

Ye toh tu jaane na
tu ye pehchane na

koi kaise
koi kaise

Yaaron ke faasle
faaslon se pyaare

ude aise
ude aise

Kahin apna
jo nazara

na dikha
ye dobara
Chahoon mein

Tumhe kaise
Tumhe kaise

Ye toh tu jaane na
tu ye pehchane na

koi kaise
koi kaise

Yaaron ke faasle
faaslon se pyaare

ude aise
ude aise
