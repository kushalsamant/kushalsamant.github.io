**Habits**.

What is the best habit that you can build for yourself?

Here are a series of habits that will contribute greatly to your growth and success. Now the first habit that I would like to build is compounding. by itself compounding is a very popular habit which has been recommended by a lot of people especially in regards to money and investing but this thing about habits the moment you build a habit it often spills over to every aspect of your life.

So, why compounding?

Youyou know there was a time when a friend of mine told me about this girl in his Masters architectural class who would make sketches: simple line drawings that she would make everyday and pin them on a wall. my friend says on the first day she had only one sketch on the wall in the small corner and nobody paid attention to it. but as days meant by she was able to fill the entire wall bit by bit as if she was doing a wall full of art brick by brick.

This is what I learnt from the story.

I I learnt that this kid wood make one more sketch then she had made the previous day. what that means if she made of sketch today she would make two tomorrow and three day after and so on. In that way it did not take a lot of days to fill up that wall. Now most of the creatives here would argue that she could have also achieved the same results by doing one sketch in a day. But that is not the point. 

See see the trouble with doing one thing a day and trying to keep doing only one thing a day is that it needs you to be consistent because if you do not make one you will be on zero. The secret to all success is being non zero. Which means that he was building habit to create art and she was also at the same time creating a hedge against failing by creating more of it by giving more than what was required of her. 

This way if she ever had to stop in between the series of creativity and go at end to something that was far more important in life he would be able to who achieved the minimum for the day and at the same time not stress about losing on time and be able to focus on the other thing at the same time.

This means that compounding is the hedge against failing at consistency.

**Hanxwriter**.

I have no clue about how fast I can type using this inanimate typewriter or if coding is something I should worry about as per the geekiness of being a static site web developer, and all the banter about those GitHub pages hosting issues. It can seem to be a pain to learn these things but it seems to me like a one-time thing, or maybe I shouldn’t bother so much on the layout, and search for the most minimalistic wordpress website, and add to the latest post like I am doing here. it may be weird to have no actual web presence since it will be harder for my remote team to contribute, unless I find another method for communications. I am tired of the way we are divided on multiple platforms. I want to limit my work to my mobile device, and my application usage to my webpage for all communications.

Maybe there is something that lets me use my email account as a web hosting site. So that all my activities focused but not limited to one platform.

**Happy X sad**.

There was a thought in my mind about randomness. Have you ever noticed that there is nothing that has an order. Even chaos theory needs you to look for the pattern before you can see anything. Isn’t the idea of essentialism lost here? If every time I need to find the pattern then am I not forcing the trend? 

There seems to be little that is diurnal when it comes to routine. In my entire commute from work to home, I have caught myself being in the exact same position at the exact same time observing the exact same time only thrice. I believe “Deja vu” is sheer coincidence. This is what happens when you have a lot of ideas roaming around in your head. There is very little that actually matters.

Most of those ideas are media, and popular trends. The result of which is the absence of mind. How many days can you remember? Days when you could describe the events that happened “as is”. Most of us cannot recall events before a week or two ago.

If you are a social media addict millennial then even that’s a lot to ask for. No wonder our society is breaking up, relationships seem harder, and ideas like “the frequency of conversation needs control” exist. Humans are social animals. I think they are more of political animals. They realized that being alone is not the best of the worlds.

So the political mind suggested being social was the solution. Our world is taking that too far. There is a saying that I hear often. “Too much is too bad.” The idea of making everything social loses the point.

There are places from cafes to spaces that binge on the idea of being social. They are clearly missing the point. If you are always going to be in a space filled with people, you will never appreciate the people. At times, you won’t appreciate being alone. Have you ever wondered why promenades like Marine Drive feel nice? 

That’s your mind telling you something. Listen! The times when you are most hit by depression is right after a Big Party. Drained of energy, and a low mood are something that will govern your life until the next Big Event. This is why people rush from one event to another.

They are running from themselves. Maybe not everyone of is happy with what they might find when they are alone. A bookstore in Cairo made a space that allows people to scream the stress out. It is a good thing. But the better thing would be to live in a society that does not need such devices to keep sane.

I am not blaming them but it goes to say a lot about the world we live in. We need spaces like those but only until we feel comfortable about being without them. The idea here is not to be a recluse. It is balance. With a constant stream of joy.

Now, the first thought that might come to your mind is that wouldn’t a bit of sadness be needed to maintain balance? My answer is No. “Sad is the opposite of Happy, that's Happy X Sad and Joy X Sorrow” We all aim to be happy. Happiness is a temporary thing. It comes with the other side of the coin: Sadness.

Instead if we focus on making an effort to keep joyful, our minds will be full and our hearts will feel content, and that's good enough.

**Hard to imagine**.

I was looking at youtube videos on Steve Jobs. Most of them displayed how self appreciation was a key to better marketing. I wonder if anyone else feels that way about Steve. I did some browsing, and reading here on Medium. Lot of good stuff I must say.

It made me think of all the things I should focus on — the businesses, the next step, the blah blah, and the needs to get done, period. I wondered if at all I had to begin that list from it’s end, I will get to a point where the rest of the list becomes invalid. I believe that what needs to be done is something we all can imagine. Rather it gets done because we can imagine it. Ain’t that easy, human?

**Harness**.

Today is sort of my last day at https://www.theblackcanvas.in/ Mummy returns at dawn, and I shall be gone. This cool pic of their camera harness reminds me a lot of my archer’s sling. Miss those days of shooting arrows in a Chikmagalur range. And the bow just says it well.

The nearer the better. The faster you pull your string, that larger shall you miss your game. There is a thing this stint thought me. That slowness is the way to capture all beauty instead. Look at that amazing detail, I am sure must be driving all you wedding photographers insane.

But the strength of a sling is in it’s straddle, and not in the bolts beware. I wish that you order at least of one these masterpieces, for the fun of making them, goes beyond any artistic care. There is so much more to do, with these on your apparel, gear. Watch that audience rhyme with envy, as you swing, and shoot with cameras dear.

**Has Bangalore thought about this?**

I am from Bombay, and the two things that I have found to be missing in my rendezvous with Bangalore are, in my opinion as an architect, major reasons for the issues with traffic, and a solution to most anti-outsiders viewpoints that have been shared to me by most of the Uber drivers I have spoken to in this city. Bombay does two things differently. Let us take a closer look at what follows at rush hours. In Bombay, the way the city moves usually takes care of most traffic problems. When people leave from offices, the traffic is divided in a vast numbers into two major segments.

Most people opt for the local trains. If you are a Bangalorean then this should translate as public transport. The rest of the crowd take to the roads, and use the Western Express Highway. Please don’t read this article, and build a fucking huge highway inside Bangalore. You don’t have the space for any expansion.

Means of transport are one of the means to tackle rush hour traffic. But hey, Bombay does it because the British already did it for them. I want you to focus your attention on the second thing. Bombay has a particular case of what I call the seaside effect. Because there is a seaside available in vast lengths for most of the citizens.

They have spaces like Marine Drive, and the Bandra Promenade, and well that’s all they need.

- You don’t have that in Bangalore. I am not talking about the sea. I am talking about 24x7 open, safe, public spaces for all. This can change your entire city in one smart move.

Here’s how it helps. When people leave from office, at say 7pm. Most people, especially those with families head for home. The rest, usually the younger generations, head for Marine Drive?-?If you are a Bangalorean, read this as the kind of public space I wrote about above. Not everyone goes to Marine Drive everyday, but you get the point — the population of office goers is split into two groups “home going”, and “chilling”.

What happens is that the pressure on the traffic is now split.

- Some citizens in Bombay have a tendency of leaving late from work because the traffic is lesser. These people either work hard, and drive a Porsche around on New Year’s Eve, or they go look at the sea, and do life talks.

Talk about the sort of controversial debate on the anti-immigrant view shared by Bangalore Uber drivers? Here’s what I see. I understand that Bangalore is more open to social drinking, at least when compared to my circles in Bombay. Most of the pro or anti western culture talk that the Uber local drivers gave me are just a matter of perspective. I think they are the locals so we should all respect their cultures.

My point here is simple — people tend to drink indoors more than outdoors. Because as an immigrant, I will explore my human nature to the best possible opportunities. This is true for anyone, anywhere. People tell strangers their deepest secrets, and fears. And people are more comfortable in risking it out on anything but their home turfs.

- So if you light up your parks, and keep them public, most of the nuisance that these drivers keep talking to me about, are out of the window. That’s how people are. People will be what people have always been — that’s people.

What you can learn is this! Bangalore does not need wider roads, because they have no space for it, or matter of fact, I think spending taxpayers money on road widening is wasteful when you can (here’s a solution),

- Build a public space, or redesign Cubbon Park (or any other space that can be walking distance from your business districts) to make it as safe as Marine Drive.

- The standard is that; if you go to sleep with your belongings open on Marine Drive, like flat down on the Promenade, no one will rob you — that safe. We don’t mess up on Marine Drive. Marine Drive is sacred. So give one public space to Bangalore, and it shall reduce traffic. It shall give people a space to mingle, and understand each other.

It shall facilitate cultural infusion. This shall give you a healthier society in most respects. If you are serious about these things, then two more examples would be The High Line Project, and Central Park, New York would increase the acceptance of this idea by some folds. Since if small roads are a problem then bigger roads is not the answer.

**Heart**.

Put your mind over the bar,  
And your body will follow.

**Hemingway app**.

The reason I stopped using hemingway app is not because I think they do a bad job. Well that is certainly not the case. They do an amazing job. My thought is that I write that way I think. I wonder how will I shape my mind, my way, if I learn by the rules set by others or in this case, the makers of a sincerely awesome app.

> “Writing is after all just jotting your mind down.”

**Hope**.

Today I saw this beautiful woman at some shop in Sher-e-Punjab. Like cat eyes, fair, and she had a cold, Stuck in traffic. The share passenger, the cab driver, and me were being all Manjunath at her. Until people started honking. And I was thinking, good but my girl be better.

Your eyes, and the way the light falls on your face, the way your skin glows under a haze, gives me hope, gives me hope.

**How to apply for a Covid19 travel pass?**

Date: 12th May 2020

If you are stranded away from home, then these are the steps to apply for a travel pass.

1. Find a doctor for check up.

2. Then get a prescription for a covid19 test.

3. Then apply for a test at any local diagnostics centers such as Suburban Diagnostics, Metropolis, SRL, etc.

- This is a tricky process because they are not allowed to administer the test if you have no symptoms.
- They rejected my doctor's prescription which mentioned no symptoms.
- They asked me to wait at the counter, and get a fake prescription from the same doctor with minimum of two symptoms.
- The test is chargeable by law at INR 3500 if you visit a test center for sample collection, and INR 4500 if the technicians visit your home for sample collection.
- Nonetheless, the diagnostic center will charge you INR 4500 even if you visit a test centre for sample collection. i.e. they will bill you for a home visit for a sample collection that they take at the test center.

4. Then take the test.

5. Then wait for 48 hours for test report.

6. Then use that report to get a fitness certificate from the same doctor.

7. Then use that fitness certificate to apply for the travel pass on the website of the state you are stranded in.

- For example if you are stranded in Maharashtra then it is covid19.mhpolice.in
- Please Google search the website for your respective state.

A. This is a tricky process because the police will ask for a vehicle number with corresponding RC book.

- This applies even if you select the public transport option on the application.
- So assuming that you don't own a bus, you will have to be hopeful that they accept your application without the RC book.
- **So you cannot go home if you don't own a vehicle**.

B. For Mumbai, the website will direct to a emergency pass for medical cases page.

- It says, if you are a stranded student, migrant, or tourist, please apply to the local police station directly.
- Upon my visit to the police station, the cops at the police station informed that they have received instructions to issue travel pass only for interstate transit.
- They have received no instructions to issue travel pass for interdistrict transit.
- The local police advised to go home in an auto or a private vehicle.
- The autos are not allowed to cross intrastate borders.
- **So you cannot go home if you are stranded within Mumbai**.

**How to develop a better you?**

Ok, so the thing is that I don't know exactly what I am doing. But I am trying to use the LiveTranscribe application. I have been working without my laptop. I have been out of the house for the past 50 days. It is hectic to type everything using my phone keyboard.

This phone that I am using has a small keyboard. It does not do justice to my flow of thoughts. I intend to record voice notes, minute by minute. So that I can copy them to my Google Keep. I hope to create a collection of notes that I can upload to Typewrighter.

It will become a book someday. I am trying to skip the process of editing by choosing my words carefully while taking these voice notes down. This effort will also help me develop a clearer line of thought with practice. So what you are reading now is actually spoken word dumped onto paper. This is an experimental process.

I intend to develop an efficient way of creating articles. Instead of thinking of a topic and then spending time to create articles around it, I find it easier to blabber voice notes and then pick the things from the rant that can be published. It's very hard to talk about certain things. This is kind of going to be more like a ramble but I like this App. The only trouble is to zone out.

It's so easy to zone out when you like thinking about things in your mind and when you try to talk about it. It is very hard to come up with the same thoughts with the same intensity and the same imagination and creativity. That it is kind of very I don't know what to say but it's been trying very hard to do this and it's not as effective. It's not as if I  thought of the whole idea of this can't be learned. I think everything can be learned.

The difficulty of how hard things are is in the fact that the only difficult part lies in not trying. The initial idea was to document everything that is for body enough to be documented, but now I think it is better to rant instead of anything else. Now the idea is to set a 40 minutes timer on a Pomodoro app. If everything goes well then I will be able to probably collect enough ideas within that timeframe. Ideas that are good enough to post on Typewrighter or something.

This strategy has one problem. I have to edit the transcript a lot. That is hard for me as a process. Firstly because I am lazy. Secondly, because of the time it consumes.

I will try to refine this process. I will keep making new articles here to keep you guys posted. One of ways I had tried was to speak out short sentences. The precision of LiveTranscribe is better in this. In this way, I don't have to edit a lot.

I am unaware of what is the minimum word count required on Typewrighter. Besides most of the articles that you post on to Typewrighter gets rejected because of unspecified reasons. They do say that it can be anything from grammar, plagiarism, quality of content, or wordcount. Their lack of specifics makes it harder for me as a writer to understand what exactly is lacking in my art. This hinders my self-growth as an artist.

I am not sure if this article can make sense to you but I am trying to do somethings differently. I am unaware if this idea of speech to text is a good idea, but I am trying to make a collection of articles from this. It is also a good way to help create a neat nice flow of thoughts. A skill that can come handy if you want to give an impromptu speech or record a podcast! Aha! For the lack of content, I soundboard to myself.

I say my thoughts out loud. Basically talking to myself. Kind of crazy but it works in creating ideas quickly. Everything can then happen because of this. I know I will have to edit these articles but the writing happens as a byproduct of say a kind of speech therapy.

Well yeah, that's it. So wish me luck. I'll see how much of talking can one document hold. I'll also see how many hours can I keep talking in one go. The best thing to do right now is to not spend money on education in India.

Instead write books on everything I know, while doing an online degree from Harvard's. Then use this degree and my books to give guest lectures globally. The most important thing to remember is to keep at it. Most things progress slowly in exigency situations. Not quitting is the key.

You should not waste your time because you have something unique about yourself. Even if you can't see it at this moment. Because very few of us can manage to resolve situations all by themselves. You have to be strong by nature in that perspective. So, you should not catch yourself doing something that you are not excited about.

More than anything else, I think it is important for you to remember all the time that no matter how distraught the whole situation is - no matter how much you might want to blame everything around you - you must aspire to be like the guys who could take a robbery designed to go down under the cover of darkness and pull it off in broad fucking daylight. Your destiny is to develop your sense of strength and power. No one should tell you what to do, stand in your way, or control the terms of your life. It's important for you to create your own rules. Even if you don't relate to your intensity, you're meant to prioritize your own experience and be driven by your passions.

> "If something doesn't excite you, then it's not for you."

**How to keep your creative writing spree alive?**

I spent last night creating a timed protocol to create articles.

1. Set a pomodoro timer to 3 intervals of 5 mins each.  
The first five minutes are for recording a basic draft using LiveTranscribe by Google.  
The second five minutes are for editing the draft into an one page article using Grammarly keyboard.  
The third five minutes are to post the finished article to Typewrighter.

2. Repeat the above session thrice before taking a break.  
My mind tends to saturate after three consecutive train of thoughts. You can choose your normals.

3. Take a 15 min long break to attend to daily tasks around me.

4. Repeat this process until I hit my target number of posts on Typewrighter.

**How to not re-invent the wheel?**.

I wish structures was an everyday thing, back in school. It gets erratically wavering between technical-informal from here on. Last night, when we were designing a house for a particular client, we were stuck on a very simple design we had just finished detailing to the T. We were stuck on triangles. My architect wanted to rest 15' high slant walls on each other — basically building a pyramid.

Only to realise later that building all the wet areas into a pyramid of wood will trample all our plans. So we waited. You know, for inspiration. “The last minute deadline”, as the saying goes. It did not take us long though to realise that we could make a box.

After all that’s what most of us, small time architects do. It feels like an Udupi restaurant when you imagine a client walk in the office, and the design team goes, What do you want? Big, small, medium, high-rise, long, short, wide, SMLXL? What do you want? So we decided to go cliche.

Only this time, with a twist. We decided to download files for 311 Fountainbridge, and adapt those to our specific geographic location. What I mean by that is — take a wooden house built in cold-dry-wet-whatever weather of Edinburgh, and plant the prototype in the torrential Indian monsoons. And Ah! All this, while it is pouring all over you. Cannot be more of a jerk now, can I?

Building a house in the monsoon season is not easy; granted. But it is definitely “the” most fun thing to do. (If you can survive a cold later). So we decided to give something back. You guessed it — the ability to do so.

We added a bathroom unit to the WikiHouse. The way I see it, now all you have to do is plonk a cosy warm/cold WikiHouse bath in your space, and add all the furniture — you have been eyeing all this while — around it. Dead simple, kinda fun. Today when we are closer to deploying the process, we figured that using existing designs even scraps or re-sourced material helps keep the time invested — minimum, budget on the low, while giving a positive outlook as far as possibility of successful execution goes. And we found all of these characteristics in what we began with.

Maybe that’s why they say,

> “Everything you need is around you.”

So, stop looking. Reflect instead.

**How to resolve a conflict?**.

We will discuss it out. 

1. I will tell you my version of the story.  
2. You will tell me your version of the story.  
3. We will state the differences between these two stories.  
4. We will state what was unacceptable.  
5. We will state what is acceptable.  
6. We will suggest a mid way.  
7. Bingo! We can go back to binge watching movies together.

**How to trade futures?**

Albeit complex methods exist which include the use of indicators, graphs, and mathematics, the simplest and time-tested strategy for trading futures is called the UP-DOWN strategy.

Trading means that you have to predict whether the exchange rate will go UP or DOWN **within** the time you choose, after you open the trade.

**Note**: I used the word '**within**' because if you see that the chart isn't going the way you chose,  
then you can cancel your bet by clicking on 'close the trade' before the time is up and save yourself from loss.

In the UP-DOWN strategy, it does not matter whether you choose UP or DOWN to start.

Start by investing, the minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, for the minimum time allowed.

In most platforms, this will mean $1 for 1 min.

1. UP: Let’s say you pick UP, $1 [$1 + $0], and 1 min.  
Here, $0 is the total unrecovered loss.

If the chart goes UP, as you predicted, then you get your initial $1 + profit i.e. 70 to 90% = $1.70 to $1.90.

2. DOWN: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case, DOWN, $1 [$1 + $0], and 1 min.  
Here, $0 is the total unrecovered loss.

Now let's say the chart does not go DOWN, as you predicted, then you will lose $1 total.

3. UP: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case, UP, $2 [$1 + $1], and 1 min.  
Here, $1 is the total unrecovered loss.

Now let's say the chart does not go UP, as you predicted, then you will lose $2 total.

4. DOWN: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case DOWN, $3 [$1 + $2], and 1 min.  
Here, $2 is the total unrecovered loss.

Now let's say the chart does not go DOWN, as you predicted, then you will lose $3 total.

5. UP: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case UP, $4 [$1 + $3], and 1 min.  
Here, $3 is the total unrecovered loss.

Now let's say the chart does not go UP, as you predicted, then you will lose $4 total.

6. DOWN: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case DOWN, $5 [$1 + $4], and 1 min.  
Here, $4 is the total unrecovered loss.

Now let's say the chart does not go DOWN, as you predicted, then you will lose $5 total.

7. UP: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case UP, $6 [$1 + $5], and 1 min.  
Here, $5 is the total unrecovered loss.

If the chart goes UP, as you predicted, then you get your initial $6 + profit i.e. 70 to 90% = $10.20 to $11.40.

8. DOWN: Once a trade is successful, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case DOWN, $1 [$1 + $0], and 1 min.  
Here, $0 is the total unrecovered loss.

If the chart goes DOWN, as you predicted, then you get your initial $1 + profit i.e. 70 to 90% = $1.70 to $1.90.

**Always**:

- Always alternate between UP and DOWN for every trade (UP, DOWN, UP, DOWN) regardless of whether your previous prediction was successful or not.
- Always choose the minimum time allowed for every trade.
- Always have patience inspite of loss.
- Always invest the minimum amount allowed for the first trade.
- Always invest the minimum amount allowed + your total unrecovered loss, if you make a loss.
- Always stick to this process.
