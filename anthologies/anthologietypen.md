**Anthologie - Type N**.

**Nadi**.

> "Badi mushkil se nadiyon mein nadi milti hai jo manzil ko paati hai. Nahi toh har lehar bas gun guna kar kho si jati hai. Khula aakash rasto ka sabhi rasto pe chal te hai. Magar kuch hai ke jinke saath raste bhi badal te hai. Ye girkar bhi nahi girte aur utthe hai nayi dhun mein. Chunauti se ye kehte hai chalo gaaye tarannum mein. Badi mushkil se nadiyon mein nadi milti hai jo manzil ko paati hai."

**Next stop passport office**.

I got a new passbook where the new printing machine printed the transaction page on the first page.
So, I got another new passbook on which the lady on the window updated the first page from her computer.

But, this page has the old address.
So, kyc records update nahi hua hai.

Because, the lady who was supposed to do it is on a 3 day leave.
So, they asked me to come on Monday.

So I had some coffee outside, then went back in the bank.
Took debit card, and internet banking form.

Tab the BM was free, so I went there and asked her if she can check status of my KYC application.
She asked for my Aadhaar, and PAN card.

She was doing the data entry herself.
So I told her that I want the Seawoods ka address on the first page because I am applying for my passport.

So she asked me for proof.
I told her that she had taken the rent agreement.

So she got the Seawoods ka address on the front page.
So I left the cabin, filled the debit card, and netbanking ka forms.

The lady on this counter asked me to get it signed from the BM.
So I skipped that, and stood in line for the single window to ask that lady to print my first page information on the last page of the passbook because address change hua hai.

She asked, "kab?"
I said, "abhi."

She asked, "last page, kisne bola?"
I said, "BM ne."

So she did that.
Then I asked the guard ki gum ka bottle kahan hai.

He said, "andar hoga."
So I took that gum ka bottle from the back office.

Put 2 photos on my passbook.
Old and new address ke baju mein.

Then I went to the BM.
Asked her to stamp both the photos.

And sign on both the forms.
Then I gave the forms to the Netbanking counter.

This lady activated it.
Then she said I will get the cards 7 days mein.

**None of this makes sense**.

I don't know if you have read the Archie's comic strip series, but there is a story in which Jughead tops the French class. Now believe me Jughead is supposed to be not so good at French. But he does it because instead of studying for the test, she goes to work at a French restaurant. Now because he ends up working with French men and women, he learns more about the language than any book or teacher could have taught him. There is a quote I don't remember by whom - I think by Lao Tzu - it says, "if I listen I will forget, if I read I will remember, if I do I will understand".

This is the most apt process to learning for life. That's what Jughead did and as far as I know that's what everyone should do. So whatever your dream is, whatever you plan to do next, start whereever you can and stick to it.

**Norfolk**.

> "Six days out in the wilds of Norfolk was something I hadn’t done since I was a kid. Being in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do, and no phone signal meant we had no choice but to relax, something that I find hard to do, and enjoy the scenery."

**Nostalgia**.

When the society is a non inclusive society, our minds are driven by fear psychosis or an inherent instinct for survival. Nostalgia is the only thing that truly binds us together. So be nice to everyone. Make nice memories. This way, you can change the world.

**Not everyone of us**.

There are a lot of people who walk in, and out of our lives. The best thing that you can learn from these semi-strange weird reasoning based experiences is to believe. Not in anything else but yourself. Most people will tell you that all your dreams will take a truck load of people working with you. But reality strikes differently.

Most of great work are done by solo artists, and entrepreneurs. Every one works their way out of a team, and to success. You don’t have to worry about all the thoughts running in your mind. Everyone has them. Thoughts linger, and vanish as if they have no sense but to trip your mind by going back to them every now, and then.

The idea is to focus. More on where you want to be than at where you are. External events are mere experiences that shape your thinking or add value to your exposure. And yes. Add value to your exposure.

That’s what everything does. Good or bad, right or wrong, these are mere adjectives. The tipping point in life is recognizing this fact. Everything is relative, every experience is a mere bar that stands in comparison to your expectations. People come in variety, and their opinion of you does not determine your value.

Those of us who work their way in teams on the side so that they can live on their individual dreams are in my opinion, playing small. We are all afraid at some point. But the idea is to believe. Not in the meaning of life, but in the meaning of your own self. We all have found ourselves in spots we cannot explain or thought we would be in.

If all experiences are a reflection of your thoughts, then shouldn’t all the surprises in life be not actual surprises? This is something I have never been able to comprehend. We try to find meaning in everything. I think that is not what the point was to begin with. We need to focus on what meaning we are adding, the value we give, and the morals we stand for.

Being bent by dogma or finding a reason to justify yourself is counterproductive. Blind faith might be scary, but it is what you need to progress, to keep moving forward. The uncertain belief in yourself, and your dreams with no light shining is a hard dive. Yes, it is a dive. And it is necessary.

Because just as — Only in the depths of the ocean that you find all the beauty our planet holds. Only in the depths of your soul will you find the light that shines within you. Not everyone of us are able to share a piece of our lives with complete strangers who park themselves in our living rooms. Serving people who visit Airbnb is an experience. Sachin & me have learnt a lot from such experiences.

Looking back now, it seems like this might be something we would do more. Because it adds value to our country, and our people. It all began as an experiment — an idea that came about when Sachin had to move out of his hostel — We set up an Airbnb, and started working as our WikiHouseBOM Chapter there. We found that we could add more value to the concept of housing. After some months of working alone, Surabhi joined us as she helped us work out the process of Crowdfunding a WikiHouse — people sharing their home with others who pay for it — The joy of sharing.

We are now graduating the concept by helping others reap the direct benefits of our efforts — #1 Crowdfunding India’s first ambisonic space dedicated for performing arts, VR, game sound design — for the community of Sound.codes. So, this is our story that will keep on growing into something better, not always bigger. I am leaving this post with a TK note so we all understand that somethings can be started without the end in sight — such as life, process, and most things of beauty in our minds. What inspires us is the fact that the most beautiful experiences in our lives — grow slowly, die a few times before they blossom, and are filled with surprises.

**Nothing has to happen**.

Look at this photograph, how abnormal it is. A mixture of concrete mass, next to the sands, and the seas, or below the mountains maybe. This is what you get, when you place two extremes besides, you can feel the angst, even without a clue about the space. As for all of us in this universe, this thought goes beyond just photographs, and maps, and charts, and life hacks, and hearts. Personal though this might be, to me or to someone else, I have come to believe, against that popular quote,

> “If it is meant to be then it will happen.”

Pause for one sec, and see for thyself: what makes you think, that we are all so special, that the bloody universe will spare, it’s resources, and time, to make things happen for thine? Honestly speaking, the universe doesn’t care, it has its own problems, well you might be the cause, for about half of them. So that kinda help, ain’t coming your way, not now, not ever. So please stop believing, in happenings, and leisure, Will Smith was right when he said,

> “If you want something, go get it.”

Because the only things that might happen, are the ones you put on your Google Keep.
