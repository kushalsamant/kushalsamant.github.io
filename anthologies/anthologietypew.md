**Anthologie - Type W**.

**Waiting**.

The joy of waiting on stations is that you realise that no matter how anxious you get waiting, Time will fix everything. You may have 120 minutes to go, but there comes a time when you have only 12 minutes left. And it does not end there. Time moves on. Beyond T-1. It goes on till you are stuck again. It’s the same time that you stopped feeling anxious about. But it is back again. As if it is a thread connecting your memories all together. At Least the ones that you cared to remember.

Then why do we measure time? Isn’t it the ether that binds the universe together? The only thing that can change your story, if you begin to play with it. If you begin to alter it. All that talk about parallel dimensions is maybe that they are a part of the same universe. Maybe they are crests, and troughs of the waves. Like mountains, and valleys, that exist seamlessly. That seem to be from another universe because we are not watching from above the waves. Maybe the laws of physics are like people, or cultures from different parts of the same world. They exist, but we fail to see them for what they are, only because we did not see them through a lens: that they are all part of the same thing.

**Wannabe**.

Why did she be, wannabe, if we had a way, would it be mine, coz the blame is, all of it. Wannabe, why did she be, wannabe, what lasts forever, never outlasts, our fantasies, coz our dreams die, all of them.

**Want to look away**.

If you have any complaints then it is that in this process I cannot look away. well actually I just called it I close my eyes when speaking out the sentence the previous sentence. I think the glare from my phone will not bother my eyes because I am talking by keeping the phone very close to me but I do wish that it would have been better if I could look away and my voice was loud enough to speak out things. it is sort of difficult to find a quiet place where I can keep recording without being filled as just by people for all the things I think of but it is also very easy to build up a room for myself where I can sit in alone and keep dumping my thoughts. This is a relief. you know I am very sensitive to things like if I watch a movie I will feel of it like if I watch Lucy for example I will feel that I can also do that because it is all about mind work and everything that you think will happen and that is such a fact of nature and it is very very inspiring to know that all your good thoughts will come back to you as good things and this will happen throughout your lifetime. So now that I have realised this about myself I think it is easier for me to be open to criticism and be comfortable in my own skin. Although I get saturated with my thoughts it is still better than having to type out and think of typing. this is like taking out a crucial block out of my life so that I can create more creatives.

**Water**.

The lord looked at the water, it blushed, and turned into wine.

**Whatever this means**.

I can understand my complete failure in trying to to bring some kind of order in my life but that is not what I think should be something that I should focus on it is interesting to know that everything that we been doing so far has always accounted for something else elsewhere like for example learn Spanish a couple of decades ago and then I had to make and girl what come into my life and it was useful then with her so I think it is interesting to note that whatever you learn today will be useful on some other day into the future and you can never know what actually will bring value to you so you know we have this habit as architects that we we would everything that we make right from the drawings to the sketches the models even to the tissues that we use to sketch out when we are dining at restaurants and cafes all of it it is very interesting for us to hope that actually it's not for us most of US dollars we just hope that whatever we have great it will come handy someday in the future but it never does it is always like this one small part of whatever we make that comes handy like of the entire range of models and sketches and drawings that having archive in my office right now probably one f****** swan image that have drawn on some tissue paper from some cafe in Bangalore will inspire me to colour painting differently and then try to make design for house of a building from 8 which is very e unique but it is sometimes questionable I often wonder if this is what we would want to have if this is what we would want to run with like the amount of effort that you might put in trying to to build something for restore something and id3 and amount of effort that you will put into you keeping everything right there and documented in archived extract and still after all of this you are left with nothing but a small impression of an idea that you might want to use later on your life I think that is a lot of effort that you put in return for the inspiration that it gives you

no I am not saying that I am a loser I am just saying that if given a choice I would like to do things you know very not orderly fashion but a very efficient way which might be very minimalistic to begin with which might also be very rustic like a refund ages or refund the sides but then everything that I've been able to understand so far from whatever has been happening in the current economy or whatever it is been happening with everything that I have achieved so far is that most of the people that I know in my life have gone ahead we had with their lives and their careers and then everything that did you like the buy houses in the cell houses and then the do something else I am not talking about architects am talking about somebody from here to take industry or someone who did any MBA or business administration course or maybe someone who learnt how to do graphics and portfolios and stuff like that so it is very hard for me to understand what I should do next in this economy because everything around me seems to be crumbling and only way forward is blank let literally blank as white sheet of linen

the most interesting thing that I like about all of this is that I am still carrying the small amount of hope that determines me from leaving the entire practice that I've been working for running Rado because it's my own practice and alternative go and take up bank job or go work under somebody or maybe just end up doing something that is completely irrational just to make up for the deficit in my entire life style that I have been able to achieve in the past decade but the underlying factors that every architect who is very renowned and very popular in all parts of the world has gotten there at the age of 68 or 70 so now I think that no matter what I do as an architect the whole process is very slow and like for example to explain this to you I think that when you look at portfolio that is been built by graphic designer for example in that designer will normally take like it has about 10 pieces of his work then that designer will take about se a maximum of 10 days to create to sing some ABC 10 months to do it ok let's please give him like good 20 months to make doston pieces of his work still it is nowhere compared to how slow architecture can be because in architecture or normal building would take me about two years or to build and if I am building highest award in there is any initial period of 5 years that goes into it limitation and permissions and other drawings and extract that I have to get from the city council and the places to get the whole project on site so we spent about five years on paper and we spend to yours onsite so that is one project and if you just doing of Bangalore and essay we spend to yours in total from exiting from the first and flying calls to the time we give him the ki so it is extremely slow so what to do and I was able to achieve in a span of se 24 months that is good for your friend projects I might be able to achieve only one single project in the time span although I can understand that most of you would argue that the scale of the project is very different because for him it is just one square feet area of paper that is trying to design in brass I might be covering set houses of square feet in the same time but at the end of it is product is graphic image or something graphical representation of a kind and my product is building your house or something that people occupy in more like a sculpture

So now having the understanding I think it is very important for me to understand if the entire economics that you are running in USA country is it viable for me to sustain as an architect or should I do something else like problem a YouTube content creator of robbery do something else that is not related to architecture in in anyway like the whole idea of building essay wikihouse for example was based on the promise that I would get to travel from one city to another and then I could make films and landscapes and document them as I was in the journey and when I reach our destination everyday wikihouse for somebody but then the whole promise is flawed because then I will have to find someone who is willing to build a house in this economy that is out of question the second option that I had was to architectural representation of different products are going on but since economy is already lo there is no way I can do that either because and because one there is a lot of people already doing at and to badi building a house or doing a project in this economy so that leads to the third option of copywriting out drawings on posters and put meaning to people as a business venture but that might be very silly idea but that also is pretty interesting if you get it also skilled version of something maybe roza drawings will come handy sometime in the future maybe they will not baby David inspire me look at things differently maybe they will not but the whole premises to find something to do that will lead to like a lot of very creative inputs so far example like I am talking to talking into the phone into a microphone so that is article get started down because I am trying to think right now I don't have time to hold my train of thought so I could get to typing right that's why I like to use a voice note program for speech to text program but whole process am stuck on is still that I don't know what to do next it's very hard to figure out if I should probably become a researcher and give up everything I worked on so far and coverage socho Na should I just continue doing what I am doing like type in notes into typewriter and hope that after all the photo of all the time they put into the centre exercise a month of it with delete the occasion of 15 joining out long f****** articles of different kind maybe that might payoff.

**What is thinking versus writing?**

So thinking is a process that you do with your own mind and then you forget about it maybe or maybe do something about it. Whereas writing is a process that you do within your own mind but you take it down on paper. When you take it down on paper your mind is already jumping at different ideas or different processes or different imagined perspectives. There is a battle that is going on inside your mind about making the right choice of words. It is hard for me as a writer or as an architect to keep these two things apart. Although I have been advised by a lot of people to not think and dump my mind onto paper I think it is almost impossible for me to do so. They have also advised that meditation will come handy if I want to achieve this kind of a mental state. But I don't want to meditate. I don't want to sit down and put my mind at rest because when I do so I will be coming my own imaginative natural self. I will also be killing my own creativity.

**What some women want on dating apps?**

First, was a girl who said she wanted commitment, intimacy, monogamy and a relationship. But her version of intimacy is not cuddles, it's sex only. She kissed me on the pavement after getting drunk the first night. She ended things after having sex a lot times on the first two days of meeting. Also I think she lied about what she wanted. Met outdoors, then went home.

Second, was a girl who stays in Pune (100 miles away) who wanted someone to come have sex with her at a beck and call notice, also not monogamy. Met outdoors.

Third, was a girl who was divorced, lives in Andheri (50 miles away) with a beagle and a cat, is flamboyantly rich, and wants to marry someone and have kids. She called me over for grocery shopping and cooking dinner together. But when I paid the visit, she said she is an insomniac, and takes sleeping pills, and her insomnia triggers epilepsy. Also in the hour we spent together, she was freakishly silent. She went to bed without saying goodnight. I slept on the couch, and left in the morning.

**What’s up with WikiHouse?**

The thought is what’s the end product or service we are offering? There are many firms in the process of building a WikiHouse, and use it for commercial purposes: competition in a commercial market. We can share our knowledge with the wikihouse project; or develop certain designs for commercial purposes; develop the model that can be scaled up or down depending on the user’s particular needs; share all our data on to the commons, and sell it off the commons on an online shop; make a WikiHouse on site for our clients; teach people to build a WikiHouse; sell components/complete design products; sell low energy additions for the WikiHouse; travel for on site assignments.

A goal here is to ease appropriation of design. An ideal way to move forward would be a book that documents all the work we have done on the project so far.

**When I lost my father**.

When I lost my father I thought I saw it coming for there was thunder in the skies, and we had about a few hundred miles to ride. For any country boy, it seemed an arduous task but when I lost my father I thought I lost a part. I often think of the things we promised from travelling to being free, from doing no man wrong to standing by one’s misdeeds. There is still a faint memory of how I asked them to pull the plug for their was life but very little left in him on that summer dusk. For sometimes you have to make a call, that shall shatter you from within but as he said when he taught me to ride I stopped thinking to just do it instead. When I lost my father I lost a cricket match I had to beg for help for a drop to the nearest pick up point. When no friends would show up a rival had mercy for this is just a small world that most live by unseen. Now I wish I would have friends again with a chance to live my life not spend time on social but making better memories. I wish for another chance I wish I had a dream, and I pray that life will show me lest what I was taught is real.

**Whistle**.

You can whistle, and so can steam, can you make a shower do that too? Today, I want to make everything open source, just because we waste resources on security. Imagine the amount of wealth, time, and thought that can be put to rest if; if only mankind gave up living, life, in a vast bubble of insecurity.

**Who owns a creative?**

Well, remember this.

1. A picture doesn't belong to you because you own the camera that was used to shoot it. 

2. A picture doesn't belong to you if it's a picture of you.

3. A picture belongs to you only if you click it.

**Window**.

Still waiting,
Looking at the window;
Typing.
I forgot about my coffee,
But I am waiting;
Till the coffee gets cold.

**Wish**.

I wish I could feel so much being constantly interrupted by life, there are few things here that can bargain for my attention. Tonight.

**Woman**.

you know how to make me drool
worry about everything like a fool
looking out at dead stars
with their light sparkling above me
wishing you were right there
kissing me slowly in the dark
:*

roam about not in the streets 
looking for things where they aren't supposed to be. 
search you heart, 
what you have been looking for 
has been there the whole time.

do words turn you on?
or is it just something cheesy
a double burst pizza
or having me after a meal?

poetry, prose, sonnets and ballads 
enriched with words so sweet
that made hearts flutter
something our generation is bereft of 
as today, your place or mine takes predence

awwww
can I move to you?
I have never found anyone who will write back to me
I guess we were destined to happen
because when everything else is a blur
you are the sweet sound of life
blinking in my eyes

"que sera sera,
we will be what will be" 
you could move to me 
and still be a thousand miles apart 
for a change, stay 
perhaps, not five feet close 
but not even a thousand light years apart!

**Writers**.

How writers fight in envy till they chip away their minds with worry of who liked whose insanity for as I look beyond their goals an emptiness awaits all that creativity.
