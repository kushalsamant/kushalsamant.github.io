**Anthologie - Type J**.

**Jaun**.

Main kahi, teri yaadon mein
Teri yaadon mein
Ro jaun.

Duur tak, jo na dikhe
Jo na dikhe
Kho jaun.

Main kahi, teri yaadon mein
Teri yaadon mein
Ro jaun.

Jaane jo, baatein tu
Baatein tu, raaton ki
So jaun.

**Jhuki nazar**.

Mere janeja tu mujhse pyaar kar 
Kabhi maane na tu intezaar

Jhuki nazar 
Kyun jhuki Nazar

Tere bin mujhko na aitbaar hai
Duniya se mujhko aitraaz hai

Jhuki nazar
Kyun jhuki nazar

Meri yaad mein tu na khud ko kho
Teri zindagi ko tu khulke bol

Jhuki nazar
Kyun jhuki nazar

Ye jahaan karen intezaar tera ab
Kyun na jaaye tu ab unke sang

Jhuki nazar
Kyun jhuki nazar

**Joan’s hope**.

We see, and wonder,
Why does a moon shine;
Under cloudy skies in furious rain,
With celestial light crashing earthwards

With doors banging away,
As the breeze turns into a gale;
You stole my heart in a glance,
And with a hangout place

You make me feel lost, and found today,
Last night we had some;
Rookie mistakes to wisdom for a change,
Like there is more in adding to a piece

Than standing out solo instead,
But of these things that I have realised yesterday;
These three are the best,
You just know when you know it’s forever

Here the past doesn’t matter,
In the end we are all just humans;
looking for an escape, a warm body,
or to shine as the moon under the cloudy skies.

These three are the best, 
You know when you know it’s forever

Here the past doesn’t matter, 
Coz we are all humans; looking for an escape, a warm body, or to shine like the moon under the cloudy skies.

**Journeys**.

I've always thought journeys to be a part of my learning experience. Like I have never seen things with different perspective unless if I were on a journey from one place to another. Once I was travelling in this train from CST to Thane and I happened to look outside the door because I was standing right at it. What I saw was series of buildings that were being constructed, half done, weirdly placed, and will work in progress for somebody. But what I realised was because I thought about the Whys. I used to always question why have they placed it that way? Why is it weird? Why is it half done? and more. So I used to look at all of these things as a set of ideas that must have come to someone. All these things around me outside of the train were only thoughts. Everything you see is a thought floating around. Everything. And once you understand this you can realise that if you can think, then you can also create whatever it is around you or create a new world of your own making all by yourself, without having to worry about the Hows. The how lies in the doing. The doing of following your thoughts relentlessly.
