**Anthologie Type - R**.

**Railway line intervention**.

Have you seen this city - the city of Bombay? It is a straight line from South to North. A line connected by one railway line or to be more precise three railway lines. Every day millions flock to work and back home on the three straight lines. There is a thing about habits.

If you want to shape a completely new you then all you will have to do is to change one habit that you currently have. You will have to override that habit with a new one. If you can hold on to this new habit for a period of merely 21 days, then without realizing you will stick to the new habit or variation of it. When I say variation I don't mean a slight change. What I mean is that if you start being okay about getting up late in the morning then you will also start being ok about getting late with everything in your life.

So now if you want to change this entire city. Do you know how would you do that? It is a very simple thing to do. All you need to do is to take that railway line and make a small change in what people do in that area. For example, if you want people to be clean and health-conscious along with a lot of other things that are related to hygiene, then you should give their ticket vendor a thermometer.

Now because of this one person in their life who is checking their temperature whenever they go to buy a ticket from the ticket vendor, they will be conscious about thoughts that come along with that temperature reading. The thoughts of being more careful about not having a fever when they are going to buy a ticket. This simple requirement will need them to have thoughts of being more careful about their health. These are further spilled over with them having the thoughts of being more careful about their hygiene.

**Reading**.

Reading for the sake of reading is no good. Reading for the sake of understanding is no good. Reading only helps as a means of collecting perspectives from different authors. True knowledge comes from comparing notes, tumbling around with the information we have so gathered, and applying to our own lives. You can have read a lot, and be astonishingly stupid, make dumb moves, and have gained nothing from it.

Take my example for reference. Reading is an act of collection. The information once collected needs to be assimilated, and pondered over, and understood in the wide scale of circumstances that your mind can think of. This process of assimilation, and understanding can be best fulfilled by writing your thoughts down. In the exact way as a graphologist asks his test takers to write.

Being, continue, and end by writing your thoughts using a ballpoint pen on a piece of blank white paper. The idea is to have a non judgmental state of mind. A state of mind that is not driven by the influence of public or popular thought /opinions. The fact that the test takers have to submit this piece to the graphologist after their flow of thoughts end, requires them to have a considerable amount of trust in the graphologist’s morals. A similar trust is expected from you when you are jotting down your thoughts to paper.

The whole idea being that your written word then would remain true to reality, lacking any outside influence, whether social, environmental, or spatial. Spatial reminds me that you must be alone, and your most comfortable place will you are at it. I could have scrolled up to add the previous sentence. Avoid such edits on paper.

**Rebounding**.

I think that all of humanity is now hit by an epidemic. An epidemic of insomnia. From the constant access to technology, and the endless need for attention has brought us all to our knees, as we search for constant validation. The race of men seemed to have forgotten the art of sticking to things. People change relationship statuses faster than they try out clothes in a lonesome changing room. Everybody has a list of impulsive needs which they will swear to come as naturally to them as butterflies know of caterpillars.

But the only problem here is that no caterpillar has ever known that it’s future holds being a butterfly. So people climb from leaf to leaf, in search of something greener, forever changing and growing, and never holding any memory of what they promised themselves on the last leaf. In the end, we will all find ourselves lying a vast wasteland of half eaten leaves, empty inside, and still hungry for more, unsatisfied. That’s the trap that you will soon find yourself in, if you do not learn to stop, pause, reflect, and standstill even when the going gets tough. The only thing that can save you in this mess of constant rebounding off people is same as the common idea of growth, career, money, or life, or otherwise anything.

The idea is to pick one thing, or person, and to stick to it, or him/her.

**Regret**.

I regret not having started Instagramming from the New Year’s Eve. This would have been so perfect. The Concord was the first racing push bike that I rode. I have had the luxury of growing up in the countryside. Where the streets have no names.

Where miles of ever-changing landscape surround you in perpetuity. Pedaling faster to not be engulfed in a monsoon shower. Where every second’s pause would mean that the clouds would take over the dry country roads. Slopes, and climbs are the frequent reminder of how life has it’s ups, and downs. Where beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.

Only if you could ease back from that frantic pedalling. Only if you could look around you. See mirth growing all around you. Seasons come, and go. The landscapes don’t wither.

Perhaps they change in shape, and form. Perhaps they have a different set of hues within the abundance of nature. Perhaps they are the reason why I found peace in some of the most lonely years of my life. All you can think of is how slowly this world changes. How it is that the slower things go, more beautiful do they become.

The slower you go, appreciative is how you feel. Where the Concord comes to a halt. Where you can pause. Where there is beauty, and life. The wisdom to appreciate it.

Regrets come from wanting. A particular result. They are fears of the past. The cure for it, as for most things in life is gratitude.

**Reh gaya**.

Reh gaya teri yaadon mein,
Ho main,
Reh gaya teri yaadon mein.

Mujhko jaane do,
Inn duaon mein.

Ho reh gaya teri yaadon mein,
Barishon ki,
Barishon ki khushbuon mein.

Reh gaya teri yaadon mein,
Ho main,
Reh gaya teri yaadon mein.

Mujhko jaane do,
Inn duaon mein.

Ho reh gaya teri yaadon mein,
Kho jaane do,
Kho jaane do inn nazaron mein.

**Relative income**.

What are we posting here?

Here's what posting written content here means.

People will rate your posts with cursors. You can cash out your collection of cursors to paytm wallet. You also get cursors for reading and rating other people's post.

Factis 1 user can give you 10 cursors max for 1 post.

Suppose there are 100,000 users.

Soevery post can get you 1,000,000 cursors over life with these margins.

Suppose 10 cursors gives Re.1.

So 1,000,000 cursors can give you Rs. 100,000 over your lifetime.

Fact is if you keep posting, make a collection of posts, keep the account active, and participate - then this process will pay out a considerable sum of money to your Paytm wallet.

Why is this beneficial?

I was once offered in job that paid me 100 thousand rupees a month. To be honest it looks like a fair deal. But what I think is not good about getting paid so much is the time that I invest in it. Every month salary is given for the work that you do in that month. You will never get paid for the work that you have done in that month ever again in your entire life. But the work that I do by writing these articles and by sharing my own thoughts and insights with all my readers here in this month will keeping me for the next month and the month after that and so on until this app exist. If you look at this entire process in this way then it is only a matter of time before you start earning more from Typewrighter than the highest paid employee in your current company.

How does this matter?

When you compare things in life people often forget that life is made not out of money but out of time. Take a seconds pause observe everything that is happening around you. This moment that you spent observing things around you is time.

Relative income is measured along the idea of time. If you make 30,000 a month then you are making 1000 in a day. Suppose I make the same amount of money in a day.

But now when you factor in time we realise that you have spent 10 hours in your day making 1000 rupees. If I put 10 hours in my day on Typewrighter and make 1000 rupees for that day then we are equals. But remember I told you I will get paid again and again for the work I have done in one day here.

So you may not get paid 1000 rupees for today again in your life, but I will. This only means that I am now making more than 1000 rupees for 10 hours of my time. This is how my income becomes more than yours even if we are equals in effort.

**Roads**.

So what happens when people are friendly, almost to the extend that they feel like a soulmate. But when they return from their travels things appear different. They have this exterior grim face that appears unwarranted for. When we happen to declutter, a lot. We realize that greatest joy is in our work, not in solitude, not in human companionship or human deeds, nor in our travels, and dreams.

I have found that travel has become a way of life for most of us. At least a way of life to aspire for. But there is one thing about all of the hype that strikes me odd. You will understand why I call it a hype, hopefully by the time we get to the end of this post. I have met many people who have travelled to almost all of the continents before they hit their 20s.

Now, since I was raised on a farm, my initial train of thought was to believe that since these people travel, they would have an exposure that makes them mature enough to know, and understand the meaning of life. At least shouldn’t that be the case? But I find these people despising a road side tea seller, for the reason that he is selling tea by the wayside. They seem to be oblivious to the fact that that is a man trying to be an honest living. I find these people complaining about traffic, about the events that happen in their lives, and about the place that they are at. After having met just about enough some 20 odd year olds, I realised why did all the traveling their parents paid for did not help them with any sense of empathy.

And the reasons are pretty simple: Their parents paid for most of it. They lived at places comfortable enough for a family to be at, which goes to say, they have always been exposed to the bright side of our civilisation. They have not seen real pain, real hunger, real emotions with no motive or gain. They have travelled, yes. But they have seen not.

They have seen the tourist places, and all the hot spots. They have seen the temples, and culture, but not the poverty, the slums, and the rot. They have been inside the comforts of a vehicle, and not on foot on a sidewalk, or stranded alone at a deserted station with not a known soul in the place they have been, nor have they seen the efforts made to survive a journey without the luxuries of a human hand to help them out. I remember once a friend quoting, “The roads they gave us a lot, but they also took a lot from us.” I never knew what she meant, until this day.

Just a gist of it, that my mind plays with, is what I have seen, and learnt from all these travel craving people around me.

**Running**.

Running across different plains, as we see the green pass by, with every turn in turn it stays, a high that drives our innate joys. I wonder if there is an end to all the things that seem to cry, there are not many things around, from an early sunrise to moonlight, that will bring a smile to my empty face, that will make me feel better inside. For today I feel so low, for every person, and every thing, that I have tried or given to, has crushed my inherent belief about myself. The only thing that shall save me is unknown, is unknown, is lost within an endless rhyme, and I am running to find out the why. But maybe I should just stop still, let the wind blow by me, show me what is that’s missing, let me realize. That every day, and every tide, comes again on a distant stride, we must make right all our wrongs, for this time is all we have, for this time is a blessing in disguise.
