**Investment plan**.

The following is a method to manage your money better.

1. Get 11 Bank Accounts.

2. Use Bank Accounts in the following ways
Use Bank Account #1 as your Main account (100% of your money) for all incoming funds. All incoming funds should come to Bank Account #1 only.  
Use Bank Account #2 as your Tax account (10% of your money or as advised by your tax accountant) for paying tax. **Transfer the tax amount to this account and pay only tax using this account only**.  
Use Bank Account #3 as your Office account (10% of your money) for marketing, office expenses, and utilities expenses.  
Use Bank Account #4 as your Home account (10% of your money) for food, rent, outings, and utilities.  
Use Bank Account #5 as your Retirement account (10% of your money) for mutual fund investments, and share/stock trading.  
Use Bank Account #6 as Cash Account for Parents (10% of your money) for parental care.

Use Bank Account #8 as Cash Account (10% of your money) for the education of any progeny.

If you have read this far, start calculating backwards from here with the question - “How much would I need for this?” - at every stage.
