**Investment plan**.  

The following is a method to manage your money better.  

1.   Get 9 Bank Accounts.  

2.   Use these Bank Accounts in the following ways.  

Use Bank Account #1 as your Main account (100% of your money) for all incoming funds.  
All incoming funds should come to Bank Account #1 only.  

Use Bank Account #2 as your Tax account (30% of your money or as advised by your tax accountant) for paying tax.  
Transfer the tax amount to Bank Account #2 and pay only tax using Bank Account #2 only.  

Use Bank Account #3 as your Office account (10% of your money) for marketing, office expenses, and utilities expenses.  
All office expenses should be spent from Bank Account #3 only.  
Upto 10% of Bank Account #3 (1% of your money) should be used for all business marketing purposes, and should earn the expected gross revenue i.e. 100% of Bank Account #1.  

Use Bank Account #4 as your Home account (10% of your money) for food, rent, outings, and utilities.  
All home expenses should be spent from Bank Account #4 only.  

Use Bank Account #5 as your Retirement account (10% of your money) for debt, gold, investments, mutual funds, and share/stock trading.  

Use Bank Account #6 as Cash Account (10% of your money) for buying real estate.  
You should buy real estate in cash only.  

Use Bank Account #7 as Cash Account (10% of your money) for the education of any progeny.  

Use Bank Account #8 as Cash Account (10% of your money) for health purposes.

If you have read this far, start calculating backwards from here with the question - “How much would I need for this?” - at every stage.
