**Schedule for quick dating**.

Here's a schedule for quick dating that I religiously followed from 2014 to 2016 to be able to blink about people. It helped me meet a variety of people from various walks of life using applications like Airbnb, Aisle, Bumble, Hinge, Facebook, Haikujam, Instagram, Tinder, and Twitter. It was a great learning experience for me.

**Scootsy**.

Today, let me share a short insight with you. After an influx of people in my life from architecture. dating apps, event spaces, or super-hosting on Airbnb, I have learnt these things. Things about successful habits, satisfaction in life, and generic human behaviours. Most people that I have met have been good at heart.

Most people are searching of a piece that’s missing from their lives. They are all looking for an escape, albeit they cannot define it. For some of us, this search becomes life itself. That’s when you go person to person, thing to thing, looking for something. That’s when you splurge your money on shopping.

But that’s not the answer. A search for what fits, and what doesn’t will always leave you empty. Life is not a search for meaning. Life is a lesson in acceptance. Accepting whatever comes our way, and see how things work.

At times, it’s starting new things, chasing a few others, or closing other ones. Life is an endless exploration. Aerosmith wrote “Amazing”, a song about it?-?”Life’s a journey, not a destination”. That’s the reason, I chose to work for Scootsy. So far, I have been able to figure that I find my escape in understanding habits.

Although, Bundl bought Scootsy, a month before I joined. Most of my well-wishers worry about the abrupt career change that I have made. I chose to work at a place full of people. People that come from different backgrounds, temperament, and life experiences. And experiences that fulfill the most humane needs that work can bring.

Work that helps deliver emergency supplies, food, and merchandise in under an hour. In my experience, even the United Nations Resource Agency has not beaten this clock. Here’s what I think is positive. Scootsy’s delivery in an hour USP helps me condition my mindset to make quicker decisions, and execute them. This is contrary to what mainstream architecture good practices.

If you have seen throughout life, “The way you anything, is the way you do everything.” For example, If you suck at finishing your food, you will never be a cleaner. Read “Relentless” by Tim Grover to know what a “Cleaner” means. That’s the jackpot. This new mindset does rub off on other areas of my life.

So, your seemingly uninteresting call center has taught me habits worth keeping. A habit of getting things done, and that of being proactive. These make laziness, and procrastination, non-existent in my vocabulary. Outside of Scootsy, they help me get things moving at other enterprises.

**Scripting**.

I have been looking across a window, and I forgot the words I had in store as I thought of what she would say more than what she wore. Ain’t that the way it’s supposed to be the way we should admire beauty I guess the thing that we lack today is meeting people without any scripting.

**Seeking clarity**.

This might sound like whining. It is just a train of thoughts. Sharing it anyways. I couldn’t agree more about the variety.

In India, there are a lot of people/ cultures/ languages/ lifestyles. Here, the vernacular/age-old methods of construction work best. I am curious about how can I deploy the WikiHouse here. People have strong faith in the vernacular styles of architecture. The masses prefer concrete for the invariable speed, and the unskilled labour it requires. // Concrete-based construction pollutes the environment a lot more than we know. I know this information is dicey. While making sketchup models, prototypes, telling the open source concept to my clients. I have found that I somehow lack a sense of clarity.

Clarity as in: Why do we not approach improvisation by working on what exists? equation: vernacular + research on vernacular = improvisation. It seems to me that we are trying out the equation: WikiHouse + vernacular = solution. Seems to be a forced derivative as a process. Now, if we want WikiHouse to be the free, shared way of constructing a house at a global scale. Then we need to find common ground between mediums. Otherwise, my local carpenter has found more efficacy in what we intend to do in the trade. Even when we did those side walls with timber members, I felt betrayed.

Well we definitely had to repurpose those doors, and windows to justify that move. I feel there is a way that lets us build more than part-WikiHouses. WikiHouse as a method where anyone can pick up any commons folder. Go to the local hardware store. Find a cutting tool not limited to CNCs — as CNCs are hard to find. Build themselves a full fledged permanent shelter in under a week’s time. The idea still fascinates me. But there is a glitch. We need standardization.

Of components, techniques, material sets based on — as you might be aware of — climate. Comments — as of now all I see is the text is moving around in circles.

Summary: Clarity of direction. To be deployable by an unskilled labourer or not. Standardization of elements. Design styles based on climates. Shoot! “We often tend to forget what we do. There are so many of us doing the same things in their own little ways.”

**Semantics of a word**.

If Tomato is Tamatar,

> T(o)mat(o)  
> T(a)mat(ar)  

> (o) = (a)&(ar)

> T(o)mat(o)  
> P(o)tat(o)  

> P(o)tat(o)  
> P(a)tat(ar)  

then why is Potato not Patatar?

OR

If (P)otato is (A)lu,

> (P)otato  
> (A)<BCDEFGHIJKLMNO<(P)QRSTUVWXYZ  

> (A)lu  
> ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO(P)>QRS>(T)UVWXYZ  

> (T)omato  
> (A)>BCD>(E)FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ  

> (E)lu

then why is Tomato not Elu?

**7**.

You will find your answer about 7 years after that point in time when you first thought about it.

**Sharing my thoughts**.

I am only sharing my thoughts. Well my mind is pretty active on most days and more during the night. Now since I have found this process of creating more written content I think I will find my happiness within this. Also it helps me improve my speech which I will probably use to record podcast or to make better videos or to have a better line of thought the flow of thoughts so it makes my entire personality better. It is so so easy and simple I can't believe it. But I would like to try and I would like to make it big. Even though I am stranded in Versova Andheri and it is very difficult to get out of your because I stay outside of the city limit I think by the time I am done with this or with all the likes that you guys will give me I might be able to afford a ride back home in a Lamborghini. you know I used to visualise certain things and most of the time the come true in about 7 years but that is because I don't focus on them I have a thought analytics float into the universe and it just floats around until it comes to its own reality by itself which is kind of creepy or that is turned off satisfying for relieving because you know that something out there is actually conspiring to act out in your own favour. and that gives me the confidence to keep publishing and to keep doing my own things without having to get a job or look for stability that most people from my parents generation would love me to have.

**She 1**.

Wonder if a woman can give another the same things as she sought in despair that saved her life indeed.

**She 2**.

She distanced herself, to save herself.

**Shift**.

Why is there an apparent hurry in the shift for the Rupee?

With over a population of 1.2 Billion people, the news seems to be reaching people after working hours of the banks. This change which will come into effect post midnight seems suspicious. The idea of applying a change in accepted larger denominations of the Rupee will hit the poor, and the farmers of the country hard. After a week down, the atms are not yet fully operational. Why wouldn’t the government print notes in advance to ease the shift? Why wouldn’t the banks be running overnight if they had to pump the economy back to the previous normal?

For a land of villages, the shift should have been careful, and considerate of all the citizens for the world’s largest democracy.

**Shower**.

I dare you, to notice detail. Right from when the first drop of water that hits your face when you wake up in the morning. The feeling that it evokes on your skin, and if you can try, all the way into your tissue. The amount of focus this requires. For you to slow down your time, and observe, to see, to feel, to understand, to discover. The way every drop of water splashes around it’s own body, and make. The reflection of light, and the mirror image of the faucet. To know, and understand that there is beauty in all things. That the most beautiful things are those that often go unnoticed. With every passing sound, when even silence is a sound, can you hear your mind’s quiet?

Feel the white ceramic as it clears your mind as porcelain, until you are left with nothing but that one thing you cannot undo, you cannot forget, you cannot ignore or you don’t want to quit. That my friend is your calling. The only thing that makes every seed of pain redundant. The mere thought of which gives you a joy to die for. And yes. Life is about joy. Not emotions, not sorrows, not thing like shopping what you don’t need. Joy is deeper than happiness. It is what you feel when the music flows from your pores, not from your larynx at bathroom singing. Where you actually see time freeze, while you make circles around your universe or anything that you can imagine.

**Sink**.

For mountains are built;
up from the ocean floor.

**16 years**.

So you know I started selling refills on the street at the age of 14. It has been 15 years since then and I have done a lot of things I don't know if most of them would pay off but I have started about 17 different ventures and closed about a lot of them get to a point where I had 20 email id state I would use all by myself running everything by myself all alone and solo only because I was afraid of the idea that if I take a job and all of that then I will not be able to actually live my life after my thirties.because then I will be stuck in the same cycle that most people that I have met in my life are stuck in it is kind of difficult for me to realise that how can people put so much for the giveaway so much for the money.I was brought up on the farms like I was born in the city but I was brought up where the streets had no names.and that has actually shaped most of my life in terms of the decisions I make in terms of the things I do in terms of the choices I make for myself and for the people I am with.

**Slept**.

Someone slept for 2 hours, someone slept for 3. I wonder what joy I find, I wonder with glee, I wonder if the love for travel, is what I seek, to find a heart that’s free.

**Slow**.

So there is this entire idea of slow. Oftentimes we comes across a point in life while making a broth that it turns out to be better if we just let it simmer, and boil up with time. Without a rush, or a haphazard frenzy to make something out of it. I feel that the secret ingredient to everything is time. We more often than not, forget about it. We rush to get things delivered. We rush to deliver things. We expect so much of ourselves, and others that we forget. We forget to live. We forget to enjoy the moment.

We forget to experience what the moment has to offer. We forget that no matter if it’s pain, and suffering, or joy, and peace. None of it will be served to us in the exact same way by life. So we might as well experience it while it lasts. We forget to feel. We forget how if you leave it be, and wait, then most things become so much better. This is true of love interests, passion projects, businesses, and even making Maggi noodles. Some things end, some last. The focus here is in not being lost in thought. The focus is to experience the moment, consciously.

- *Slow things down, and everything becomes more beautiful.*

**Slowly intro**.

Hi you!

My name is Kushal Dhananjay Samant.

Welcome to my feel good about myself page. :D

As for my relationship, I think going grocery shopping, and cook dinner is a fabulous date idea. I really want to find someone open to travel the world in trains with me. I want to have great conversations and a lot of sex. I'm looking for something regular and long term with or without the commitment. I want to spend time in this city, buy groceries, chill at my place with my partner, buy groceries, cook meals, eat, have 2 am conversations, rough sex, sleep, wake up to make breakfast, more conversations, movies, music, maybe art, &c.

I am an ENFJ-A. I was born in the city and grew up in the places where the streets had no names. I am an academic @dypca, aeromodeller, @airbnb superhost, angel investor, architect @kushalsamant_, author, chapter founder & dev @wikihouseproject, film-maker @youtube, lyricist @saavn, podcast host @anchor, top @medium writer, &c. I write about the programming of human behavior using architecture. By day I work on the WikiHouse project, host on Airbnb, build off the grid houses by GRÜHAM. And by night I do architectural research projects through my architectural practice.

I am looking to have people I can chill with. Know that I can count on them. Some of them might become friends. Few of them might become best friends. And one of them will be okay being with me without tags. Then someday, someone will want me to spend the rest of my life travelling with her.

I am sending out this random letter in the auto search option. I wish I could make this unique for you, but then the app wouldn't let me. Either ways, if you want to talk to me in this global pandemic, feel free to write to me. I have made friends with many and met three people from Slowly so far. I am looking for more such amazing experiences.

I live in Seawoods. That's in Navi Mumbai. This is mostly going to be long distance. I will understand if you want to walk away because of that. You may find better guys nearby. But if we are meeting then I would like to have the option of staying over, open. Because travelling back home is a task in the middle of the night.

I love big eyes, cars, cities, cold beer, cold coffee, conversations, cooking, cuddles, cycles, design, dogs, farms, films, food, grocery shopping, long walks, maps, nature, open backs, outbacks, outdoors, Oxford comma, pizzas, random ticket travelling, rough sex, running, seafaring, silence, spontaneity, swimming, teamwork, thought processes, travel, turtles, unconditional friendships, and unusual names. What do you like?

My grand aunt is a monarch. I have stopped a country from deporting a Frenchman. I have written one, and read 999+ books.

Once I left with a roommate to have chai, got on a bus to Kerala, called Malayalee friends for a week-long free stay, & pooled money for return tickets.

The hallmark of a good relationship is a honest commitment to stay in it. This is never 50-50. It almost always is 0-100, 20-80, 40-50, 60-40, 80-20, & 100-0 over prolonged periods of time.

The week of the 3rd of January, 2018 was a week when I lived my life at weddings, travel, meeting people, and house parties. 3rd of Jan is also a date when I got my tattoo, back in 2011. There is a thing about the New Year's Week - It gives me a reality check. I am glad that this app led to remind me of my dreams.

Yours truly,

**Slowly letters 8**.

Is this your real name?

Well, I love writing long letters. :P 
Yes, I did move around because my parents moved around for very specific reasons. I moved around in search of greener pastures, or for someone, I was dating then. Mostly for projects.

To move around, well the fascination lies in making the journey. The newness of it all is exciting. I have never got tired of moving around. You should try it too. :)

Wow. is IT in Chennai a common thing? Do you write code too? Or are you a tester? I have a profile on GitHub. But I made that to code my website on GitHub Pages. Nothing fancy.

Do you have pet/s? I read your bio. I would like to know more about what you think of photography. Do you share? VSCO? Instagram? EyeEm? 500px? or are you a photographer who does not share your clicks?

Wow. I have been to Mysore thrice in my life, and Chennai once. I always wanted to spend more time in Chennai, but the weather is too hot than what I can take. Where did you learn Telugu? I love learning new languages. I used to go on online chatrooms, sign in to a room of any place in the world, say Sarajevo. I would ask if anyone in the room knew English. If I was lucky to find someone, I would ask this person to "translate: How are you?" in their local tongue. I would pick up translations for phrases like this. After my tutor went offline, I would chat in the local language. I would make note of any unknown phrases to run by my tutor later in time. This process is damn helpful. It is kind of taxing to maintain a journal of all the phrases but you can make two columns in a page, and write down English | Local Language to keep track of things.

Happy New Year to you!
I don't do new year resolutions. Instead I keep working on whatever it is that I am working on in the last week/ first week of these years. I aim to move out of my mom's house. I want to go to Bangalore to help a friend out. I want to get a sustainable secure job. I want to start traveling the world. Maybe moving abroad. Also, my birthday is on the 31st of Dec. When is yours?

Question for today: How many friends do you have? Please do elaborate on the positives of these people.

Yours truly,

**Slowly letters 5**.

My mom's family is from Telishery, Kannur.
Dad's a Maharashtrian.

Assistant Professor sounds so cool :P
I have a keen interest in psychology but never got the chance to read a lot about it.
Congrats on the job :)
M.Phil and Ph.D. and then what's next?

I am currently job hunting, waiting for a legal process for my inheritance to get done.

Well you have done your masters :P I haven't yet. I need to do a lot of catching up to do with adulting. I did most of the things simultaneously. This happened because I help other people solve their problems, and as a result involve myself in a hoard of things.

Well I stopped deportation of a French national who was a guest at my Airbnb. It's a long story about how NMIMS's exchange program staff did not get the right stamps on his VISA and tried to send him back under the premise of proving his residency in this country as invalid. I will tell you that in person, on call, or maybe somewhere we can talk. Soon enough.

I am probably going to stay put in one place for a while, and then travel for 5 years in a row. I haven't really been to popular places like Gokarna, or Goa alone. But I visit different cities all by myself and usually have a group of friends joining me.

Saudi Arabia is a tough place na.
I so want to visit Kochi Muziris Biennale next year.
What's your hometown in Kerala?
I was in Bangalore, from 2017 Septemeber to 2018 June.
Do you like Delhi? I have never got a chance to move to that city.

I watch Tamil and Malayalam movies. I like Tamil songs. Which songs do you like? I wanted to learn French only because it is compulsory if you want to move to France. 

I think USA is not a good option. Bad place to be rather.
Canada is amazing, but only if someone comes along with me :P
Maybe we can travel together then.

Why are you worried about life? 
Isn't it better to make a list of things you want, and go for it?
You can always improvise your plans if you fail?

Well it's ok na. You have a masters degree.
I am sure if you try again, you will clear it.
Besides you already know a lot about clinical psychology.
Why not do an M.Phil in a related subject, and then do your Ph.D. in clinical psychology? 

I was not aware that we don't have an All India Entrance Exam.
You must have travelled a fuckloads for these exam, and interview rounds?
Where all have you been?

3 years old is so young! I am sure you have an amazing mind too!
Oh! So how many siblings do you have?

My oldest memory is probably around when I was 4. I was in the living room look inside the room. There was a sofa in front of me with a window beyond it. My mom was standing at the window looking outside, waiting for Dad to come home from Mauritius. I remember asking her, "What is Kushal? Since everyone calls me Kushal, what is Kushal for me?" (Answer is "Name") I think I spent about 15 mins getting my point across with whatever limited vocabulary I had.

Today's question: What inspired you to do psychology?

Have a nice day.

**Slowly letters 4**.

Thanks for writing your name. Most people here do not write their names on these letters. It will help if we run into each other someday. :) 

I am currently in between jobs. I am still weighing my options career-wise. I write a lot these days for my newsletter and website.

A bit more about Bangalore. This project is about creating and publishing 5 architecture books that should sell 5,000 copies at Rs.200 each in an year. This is not an easy task. If successful, I will get paid 2,500,000 by the research firm that wants to employ me.

Problems are that,
1. They are willing to spare 10,000 a month for my retainer.
2. They want to invest 6 months of time in the making of these books. This might not be sufficient to get it done.

The benefits are,
1. I *may* get 2,500,000 after 6 to 12 months.
2. a. I can build network of subscribers for my written content/ newsletter.
3. b. I can build awareness that I curate portfolios and make an entire social media strategy as a service.

The alternative steps are,
1. Finishing Revit architecture certification from AutoDesk.
2. Getting a job at an architecture office in Mumbai for 35k to 40k a month steady income.

Damage control options are,
1. Using Bangalore's retainer to get Revit architecture certification from AutoDesk by February.
2. a. Returning to Mumbai and following alternative step 2.
3. b. Using benefits 2. a to host interested folks at a farmhouse on Airbnb. I could also do architecture competitions with the money I can make on Airbnb. This will then be a full-fledged practice.

In conclusion fail safe paths are,
1. Damage control 1. & 2.a.
2. Alternative steps.

Enough about my dreams, and work!

Well enough about me.
You are trying something new. That's interesting enough. :)
I know this letter is too much to take in. I am making a list of questions at the end here, because duh! :P :D 
I have so many questions for you! :D
- What is your birthdate?
- Where all have you lived, and traveled so far?
- What did you study?
- What all are you learning currently?
- What kind of work do you do?
- Maybe you can help me learn more about the Canada bit?
- Do you have a reading list?
- What's your favorite book?
- What are you currently reading?
- Do you photograph?
- Do you have an Instagram page or something?
- Can you tell me more about sustainability?
- Do you have a kitchen garden?
- What all are you curious about in life?
- What's on your bucket list?

Happy Christmas to you too!!! 
Yours truly,

**Slowly letters 1**.

Hahahahaha, let's write longer letters :P
since these may take days to reach you/me.

Well, those things I did happened over the years, say about 15 years. I am sure a lot of people do many things, but don't write them down in a list like I did. I am sure there is nothing spectacular about it.

Where are you originally from? Where were you born? Or did all did you move to?

My story goes like,
90 Borivali, Bombay
96 Nerul, Navi Mumbai
98 Kudal
08 Belgaum
11 Belgaum, and Bangalore
12 Belgaum
13 Bangalore
14 Seawoods, Navi Mumbai
15 Bandra, Mumbai
16 Andheri East, Mumbai
17 Malad, Goregaon, and Bangalore
18 Bangalore, and Seawoods, Navi Mumbai
19 Seawoods, Navi Mumbai

I used to be in Mumbai for vacations.

😛 I am not that interesting, it's just that I talk a lot. For example, hold a conversation for 8 hours on first dates. Probably that's why I could take lectures. I once did a photography project of shooting pictures of myself everyday to see how my look changed as my beard grew after a clean-shave to a bear-face. I should upload that on my Instagram.

I live in Seawoods, Navi Mumbai these days. Today, I am at a place called Aarey Milk Colony. I am spending some alone time at a friend's house, who isn't here, who is visiting folks. I will stay here until this friend returns from home on the 2nd of Jan, or until my birthday, 31st of December, I don't know for sure, let's see.

India is a big place. I have travelled to most of the states during my architecture college days, and I have so much left to see. Maybe someday I will travel it all.

I have never travelled abroad. I got my passport 16 days ago. I have always wanted to travel the world and film landscapes enroute. Would you be interested to join the team?

Also, I have been thinking of moving to a different country for a job. Popular options are Canada, Australia, or New Zealand. Argentina was on my mind, but it was a forgotten choice. I can't speak Portuguese, or Spanish as my one Brazilian and another Argentine friend does. I need to practice these. How many languages do you know?

Tell me about yourself. What all do you do in life? Do you teach?
Made in India with ❤️

**Slowly letters 7**.

Yes. My parent's marriage is one of a kind. Maharashtrian guy, Malayalee girl. Guy's from a patriarchal society. Girl's from a matriarchal society. Guy's a capitalist. Girl's a communist. Guy's family is religious. Girl's family is not religious. I was born in the city. I grew up in places where the streets had no names. Such a mix! I feel like I have seen the best and worst of all worlds.

It wasn't a big deal back then, somewhere in the 80s considering that they belong to families that have owned banks starting from my great grandfather. I am not fluent in Malayalam. I can survive in a gathering of cousins though :P

I have been to Kerala 4 times in my life. Once with the family when I was a kid to Kannur. Once with my aunt and her family to Kasargod, I think.  Once on a college tour when I passed through Kerala on my way to Bangalore from Kanyakumari. Once with my college roommates on a very impromptu trip to Mananthvadi, Wayanad.

I am not a Bombay boy, definitely not a South Bombay guy. I don't know what I am. I am a mix of different things in this city. For example, you know when you can go from "kidhar hai bey" to "Kasa kay bantai" in less than a second. :P

Childhood was filled with a lot of things. A mix of bullying, fishing on bridges, river rafting, traveling in the countryside, wildlife. I think I can tell you more about instances of being brought by parents from two entirely different cultures if you can ask me a lot of specific questions about it :D

I have heard of Thiruvalla, Pathanamthitta. I am not aware of its geographical location. But isn't that a temple town? Is it in Wayanad? I am not sure but it sounds familiar.

My passion for making small airplane models, fly them in vast open country plains and building things, in general, led me to architecture. I wanted to be an inventor. I still do. I did not know much about architecture when I thought of doing the degree. As it is, Architecture is a small niche of itself. To add to that, I was in a rural area during schooling years. I don't know much about architecture yetI Tell me one thing, why do most women in Psychology join the field after they meet a psychologist? I have heard this "met a psychologist, and was inspired by how he changed people's life" story umpteenth times now :D

This is new information. I always thought that masters were enough for psychologists to practice in India. Never knew an M.Phil is necessary too. Is this specific to clinical psychology only? or is this new rule applied for every branch of psychology?

I think education in India in every field is lagging behind the world in terms of practical exposure. It's a vicious cycle, especially when colleges hire their current graduating batch to teach the next batches. Like why the fuck would you do such disservice to others!

Woman! Most psychologists are always hot and bothered. Too many psychs would make the population rate spike! Are you sure you still want to increase the capacity of those colleges?

So you are in going to be studying in India 2024 at least. I just realized it's 2020 in the next 3 days. Fuck my life, I am growing older! Oh, your mom is a Malayalee in Canada? That's a first! :D hahaha. 

I want to road trip around the world. I need a job that pays me well for it. I will move or not move depending on where it is. If these constraints are waived off then I will probably think of Canada or maybe France. Have you seen the streets in Paris? They are ❤️. 

If not Canada, then what's on your mind now?

Whenever you make a to-do list, keep the clock away. 
And when you are doing something, don't pause, or stop, or take a break, until it's done. 

I am aware that this process will get tiring, so you have to make the to-do list as detailed as possible, include all the steps in it. When you get tired, work on a different step. We often don't realize but - A change of job is also a break/ relaxation.

This is also the answer to your earlier question of how did I manage to do so much more in life at my age.

I need a travel partner. period. For company, intimacy, and sex. Not always though. But then if I leave her/you alone I am bound to have trust issues in the first few months of being together, then things normalize.

It's funny how most people go on these solo trips, and realize that they are not happy with their lives, and weird enough everyone goes on an "ending things, ending relationships, quitting jobs, getting a haircut, ending epithelial life (tattoo :P)  spiral" instead of a "fixing things spiral". Like I haven't found anyone who would come back from a journey and want to continue their life as it is. Such people must be rare.

So you have traveled this country in the "I went to work in Switzerland but the Alps were always behind that glass window" sort. :P

If you want to add me/ message me/ or whatever on Instagram, do let me know it's you, and then when I follow you back, accept my request. Else I will think that you are just another cute married girl trying to lead a double life :D :P

I am researching on the programming of human behavior using architecture. I use this a lot in my architectural work. Mostly because they are all event spaces. That means places that are dilapidated when I and my client go there. Then I measure it, sketch it, discuss the options my clients will have if he gets that place on a lease, then I draw it, make a model, discuss some more by looking at the model and then I give my client the final drawings to begin the work by the end of the day. I guess writing and drawing architectural solutions is the only thing that I am pretty fast at. I need to capitalize on this. :D

Question for today: Do you make/ build or curate stuff?

Yours truly, 

P.S.: :P I am thinking of publishing these letters into a book format.

**Slowly letters 6**.

I am doing great.

You are most welcome. I love writing long letters on most days :D 
Hahahaha, intermittent fasting only has the idea of eating you out attached to it :P It must be a bold move for an introvert to come over such a platform. That's so brave of you.

Yes, I do write long letters on most days. Well, it does take a lot of time and attention, but I do it for the joy of it. I have a slight level of OCD, and I am a stickler for great communication, words. I often lose my cool if people misrepresent or stretch facts in a discussion.

I am looking for someone to travel, and experience life with. I have lost the hope for love. I tried dating apps, but after 2000 first dates, and many many flings, I realized that in the end, we are all alone. You did a wise thing by not looking for love outside. I am sure love will find you now, much like the Sorceror's Stone - It comes to those who don't seek it. I am sure peace and serenity follows :P

I guess we both share the same interests - to earn and travel every place on this planet, and yes! Dogs!. They are ❤️. I don't want to have my own kids. Maybe adopt a kid, but then it's expensive to raise a child. I always wonder how does this become more expensive for every new generation.

I am an architect. Creativity or not, I often try to solve problems for other people. There is a lot of satisfaction in lifting the weight off someone's shoulders. You should try it sometime. I have my good and bad days, so I am not sure if this nature always attracts positivity, but it sure does attract depressed souls in search of positivity.

Well if you want to plan to move then we can might as well exchange phone numbers, share notes, and help each other. I love trekking. I actually like the Instagram photos under #britishcolumbia or BC as they call it.

I hope it begins without the risks that I run with losing things. Thanks for the wishes. My mom works in a bank. So that's her only home. She lives in a rented apartment in the city. So clearly, I'm not rich, yet :D

Well strangers or not, how does it matter! I get to journal here, organize my thoughts, and also get others to tell me what they think. Who knows what might click somewhere, and everything will start to make sense, no?

What do you mean? What did I inspire you to do? 

I learnt those languages on online chatrooms, and as an Airbnb host. Talking to people who can speak in English, and learning their language over time. This takes a lot of time and effort too. Like these letters.

I have never been a fan of spiritual books. But I guess yours must be a Bong thing, since most of my Bong friends read them a lot. I read non-fiction, self help, autobiographies, and something classics or fiction. I am not a huge fan of fantasies. I write eroticas though.

Why do you have anger issues? Can you tell me more about it? I love writing letters more though. It's therapeutic.

My birthdate is 31/12/1990. You are writing a CV yes :P I can't help but believe you. What exactly is the project about?

Well, you should explore Bombay. My plans are going to be an expensive affair. I want to do all those things I spoke about workwise before moving out. That's great!

My brother is a photographer. What is on your reading list? Do you have any recommendations? I can't wait to know more about sustainability. I am curious about human behaviour. I will probably read about it in the coming year. Which plants do you have? 

From today I started uploading my pictures, and art on my vsco.co account.
Shy is not a great thing to be :D You don't know what you are missing out on in life experiences.

Yours truly,

**Slowly letters 3**.

Can I know your first name? It helps add context :P Maybe if we run into each other someday. :) Yes I got bored of writing a bio, so I have my website bio here :P Well it clearly works to get people to reply to me :D

Thanks! For all of these compliments. :)

I never knew Kolkata was called the City of Joy. What kind of research do you do? I might move to Bangalore to complete a research and publication project at an architecture firm there :) I lose my patience when people cannot discuss things calmly and in-depth :P What all are you learning currently?

I agree you are single because you might not have the freedom to get guys over :P I like people who hate selfies :D The beard and face project was an exception :D What's on your bucket list? Where all have you lived, and traveled so far?

How big is your garden? Is there anyone who doesn't love Coldplay? :D

Happy Christmas to you too!!!
Yours truly,

P.S. You can see my pictures on my Instagram. I am currently curating my entire photo archive from Google Photos on it.

**Slowly letters 2**.

Corinthiana, that's such an architect-y name na. :P Where did you do your architecture from - as in which college?

I loved Slowly but after a while, since we are like 2 hours away by flight, this will feel like intermittent texting :D Also there is none of the post office being shut, none of the visiting the stationery store for envelopes, and none of the figuring out of how many postal stamps do you need to paste on the letters, plus the argument with the postmaster on how much postage they should charge and jazz. Yes! I have had many penpals back in the day. I have all their addresses committed to memory :P I am being such a boastful ass now.

Write anonymously. I don't care. But knowing your first name is preferred. Maybe someday I will find you in some architecture event. Maybe someday I can do something with that. :P

I am on slowly because I work solo. I get bored often so talking to people helps. Also, all these questions that people ask give me a point of reference for myself. It's kind of a reality check and self-discovery. This is also the reason I am anywhere I get to talk to people, like dating apps and jazz. I wrote the bio from my website because I was too lazy to type out a new bio for Slowly :P

I like being in new places, and you can always revisit the old ones. Newness, and nostalgia have their own charms. I often do this thing of pausing everything, gazing into the horizon, and burning that moment to my memory. This is probably something that I have never told anyone. Where all have you lived exactly?

Are you an art teacher? :P 
At times, I write not-subtle-at-all erotica.  🙈 
Just playful tease :P nothing more. I love keeping things on edge on somedays.

And no! My fetish did not inspire me to be an architect. The things that inspired me to be an architect was my love for doing everything. I used to make small airplanes at 13, make models of stuff, sell refills on the streets after school, not because the family was poor or anything like that, but just because I loved it all. I am a generalist, not a specialist :P something like that.

I am thinking of moving. I want to move because I want to travel the world. Roadtrip the world, and film the whole trip on camera. Not marry anyone and travel! I think this also answers your last question :P This life dream requires a lot of self-funding that the Indian economy does not give me. For now, I just got my passport na, so I am reading up on the matter. Bangalore, Canada, Eastern Europe, and France are on my mind.

Work license is not an issue in most countries. Also, you cannot afford to run an architectural business without a local partner. I collected these local partners when I was in the 2nd year of my college. So right now, it is a lot easier for me to move to any country that lets me employ myself as an architect, with them, or under them. On the other hand, I can always work in a firm without having any contacts.

You do know a lot of languages. I can speak let me recount - English, Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Kannada, Spanish (6). Dialects - Malvani, Hyderabadi Hindi (2). Beginner - German, Bosnian, Serbian, Turkish (4)

I think everyone is trying to figure out what to do in life. This is an architecture thing. You should write your thoughts down. Or tell it to someone else without looking for a response, or say it out loud to yourself. I call this as sound boarding. And the person you do this with is your sounding board. More like how the board of directors of a company is. Ideally, make a list (ideally on paper), and ask a simple question, "Do you want to do this?" - then apply this rule - "If the answer is not a clear YES, then it's a clear No!"

Would you like to work together? We could be a lot of fun. In life, I am literally at a point in life where I can do whatever I want to do with no past commitments. Let me know, and maybe we can beat the world at it :P Also, I have got space, if you are open to the idea. Let me know.

I teach architectural design, graphics & drawing representation, and AutoDesk software to students up to the 4th Semester. 

I asked about the single bit because every place is an amazing place to find good platonic love. Unlike dating apps, it's slow-paced, and we get to know each other before anything else. I am not looking to marry. For me, it's travel first with my partner, then buy a piece of land, with a lot of dogs, basically having a kennel.

Also, I _might_ ask you out someday, or I _might not_ ask you out at all, we never know. There are no expectations. I like your bio. I am going to try and reply to your letter now :P

- What is your birthdate?

- What all are you curious about in life?

- Tell me about your favorite architectural structures. - Bridges, I love bridges. The ones like Erasmus in 
Rotterdam, Netherlands.

- I love listening to any kind of music but metal. As for songs, the lyrics should have a good story in it. I would like to read books, but then I realized that the movie covers that same story in 3 hours or so. So that's lucrative :P  I love playing minesweeper. Now I am your favorite person :P

- What are you currently reading? What's your favorite book? Do you have a reading list? I love reading.

- Do you have an Instagram page or something for your photography? I love Instagramming. Remind me to share this after we know each other really well. For now, I will live in suspense :P I like people who hate selfies :D The beard and face project was an exception :D

- I love being by myself. I try sketching on tissue paper at restaurants. I do all my site work on sketches, and you are exhilarating. I never got access to Korean shows. Help me out there!? I love walking, and I have only once heard someone use the word Southpaw before. Gosh, you must be sculpted as fuck. I really need to hit the gym too :P 

- P.S: All kinds of a gym, to sharpen me overall :D

Gosh! I did write a long letter. Let's see if you can reply to this one and not get bored doing so :P Sorry typing to all of this is going to take a while. 🙈 I am not asking you a new question at the end of this letter because duh! :P :D

Yours truly,

**Smaller**.

If you have read Stupid White Men by Michael Moore, then you would know that Men demand bigger things. Not the women of our society, but the men. As far as I am concerned, smaller things work for me. The smaller the plate, the lesser will be the food I would want to serve myself, the lesser will be the wastage if I don’t finish eating. Also, I will be concentrating highly nutritious food on that plate now that there’s a limit I chose to run with. Smaller has an advantage. Much as the fable goes, David, and Goliath. You can complete daunting tasks by going one at it in bits. Bits, not pieces, see! That small.

**Small things matter**.

From a laugh to another sneer from a closet talk to banter dear. Small things matter beyond normal stature from a withering smile to constant telephonic chatter.

**Smoking**.

Smoking to keep away my hunger
While the pain fuels my curiosity
As it lingers.

**Smoking easy**.

Trying to get something out of it speak in a particular level of volume to get this thing done right and it will not pick up the words are saying this is a very good way of practicing your thought flow your speech the tonality that is used in the space of your words that come out of your mouth piece not space not piece, pace. see can talk to the phone and you can also direct instructions to it so it is a very good way of recording your voice and make it into a text article for all I know you can also be smoking a joint or something while you are doing this it's very creative way of doing things, just saying you could do it. show the process is a very small process it takes less than a minute I initially thought it would take me a lot more time but that is not the case. This is kind of a marathon but this marathon will be off for generations to come.

**Social**.

There was this one who found an answer to everything that I found lying deep inside cracked under the sun from an ancient shrine to an abyss divine. I thought so much for the future that lie, and a past that haunts tremendous baggages to hide, to let go with wonder, to find joy, with a vacay around the bay; tonight. I wish I could write better poems for now the city drinks itself to false joy in gulps of alcohol, and marijuana lit; there must be someone who goes beyond all wits, someone who can see, and holds to the hilt; those rules they made as in Sun Tzu’s times. Often we meet such random souls but that’s not our true self or a distant goal all of us crave for attention so much more that we crash into actions and people that are gore. Only to find that alcohol does not, does not find us joy, only hangovers for a moon, for when a new sun arises, and lets us know; there is so much more to life, and life in store that we might just drop the idea of drinking, and find our joys not in people, but ideas for sure.

**Social media differences**.

- Facebook, Instagram is an avenue for joking with your customers, and running competitions or giveaway. It’s a place to build a “cult following.”
- Twitter, Medium is prime real estate for getting personal, and talking directly to your customers.
- G+, LinkedIn is a professional landscape, geared toward connecting businesses, and professionals with each other, and opening the door to engaging with individuals outside of your usual social circles.

**Soundboarding**.

So what are you saying is you know what is sound boarding?

Sound boarding is basically process in which a person say for example me e I will talk to you about my problems for probably about things I am doing in my problem I will tell you the story of my life or of my project and in process of telling the story of my project I will be able to figure out all the blocks that are coming to me e that I am currently trying to solve in that project. now sound boarding does not necessarily involve a lot of involvement from your end.except that you will have to probably listen to everything I am saying without interrupting or maybe with a bit of curiosity and with a restaining agent. What I mean to say is that you will pull me back if I am digressing a lot so that is all your supported and if you are an expert of the topic that I am discussing then you will give me your inputs which might not be like a lecture which will be just small tweak in my flow of thought and all those inputs will add clarity to my slow of thought and it is what will generate the answers to most of my problems that I am facing currently.

I deal with questions that people have difficulty in solving by themselves.

I create a step by step path for someone to get from point A to point B.

How do we do it?
1. you talk,
2. give me a complete idea of what you are doing,
3. then you tell me your problems,
4. then we will talk about what you have tried so far,
5. then we play tetris with all variables,
6. then we will know what works best in the current scenario

**Space aching**.

Time, space, place & play. Often we seek spaces that resonate with the depths of our darkness. A reflection that is subtle like the glow of a street lamp. Our most memorable moments are hidden in these alleyways. Their influence transpiring all space, and time. A space that is a replica of our mind. A time that is mind play.

A place where the wind blows the fuel inside our thoughts.

Like a setting sun under a bridge, and the cold wind upon nightfall. Find me there at peace for eternity. When the quiet stays unbound. Willingly as it may seem, without the clutches of being time bound.

But I have often found that addition of an architectural piece in a village’s fabric does some keeda with the people. Their sense of freedom which lies in the fields, and the countryside now feels challenged by the staunch neatness of the new neighbour.

They aspire to be that neat. They aspire for that progress…materialistic progress. But hasn’t human aspiration always been about discovering, and experiencing the new? The stuff that we speak of wanderlust, and living like gypsies? The desire to travel? Does all of it fade away in the pursuit of beauty in other things? Is this what is happening to this city?

Now, I am not against big bank balances. But is the purpose of it fundamentally flawed? Is it questionable? Is it a clear ‘yes’? Is Mumbai losing itself in the materialistic version of the human adventure spirit?

**Space is an emotion**.

Space is an emotion, is an attempt to illustrate certain observed notions between human emotions and the spaces we inhabit mostly through the practice of creating architectural spaces.

![_Photo by Isaac Quesada_](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1587308550198-10dde4bf9ba0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjI2NzI5fQ)

Space is an emotion, and a rather strong one. Space effects almost every aspect of a human life, not excluding what we share with each other. Every kind of space that you walk into or even crawl into at times, generate emotions that we experience in various spaces. Emotions contribute to the making of a place. Some of these factors that lead to changes in the subconscious thought. I understand that human experience is subjective. Sometimes beyond the human capacity to measure. Here, I attempt to illustrate certain observed notions between human emotions and the spaces we inhibit, mostly through my personal experience while pursuing my architectural works. The understanding of human behavior has been the key to designing event spaces or rather businesses that thrived on the concepts of people paying for their time spent at these venues. It was crucial to dissociate money from the experience.

A better way to put it would be to say that creating spaces that contributed so much more to wellness, so that most people would prioritize their lives around these spaces. My intentions for documenting are clear. To curate the intentions that I held while designing spaces in different times of my lives. To help you understand the lessons I have learnt in passing so that you may benefit from these design approaches. A human understanding of space is directly related to scale. This means that space, an empty space works differently for a dwarf, and for a giant. If you can imagine, yourself being still in any kind of a space, then you will also acknowledge to the existence of an extent of ownership that you would wish for on your surroundings. Humans consciously limit themselves when it comes to territory, even in their own imaginations. This peculiar behavior exhibited by the human mind, differs for each individual. This is what makes people unique. Ownership, not belonging.

Humans have a way of observing a lot of detail in the first experience of any kind. This is why movie scenes seem longer, dialogues come of as bolder, and space feels blurry in the first instance of experiencing. Cats have a tendency to go back the same way they entered an area. This is also true for most of us. Since the human brain is wired to play it safe (a natural evolutionary approach to survival), we do not change our paths or explore new paths around a complex, involuntarily. A new approach takes deliberate effort. This can be played for the benefit of the designer, by placing elements in a specific manner. In ways that the usual suspects will follow the same guided path to receive the intended experiences that await them. Museums use sign-ages or sentry to guide people along, into, or away from certain areas. Our aim should be to let the elements do the talking.

The human mind is always listening. The individual space can be designed based on the tastes and nature of the client. In spaces where most of us have been to, to attend any form of social gathering are shared. This is where complete privacy walks out. Sharing works differently. Sharing creates bonds. And when sharing spaces it creates shared ownership first, belonging next, and a community later. Remember, birds of the same feather flock together. It becomes essential for commercial venues to curate or contain the crowd they serve. Since these businesses are built around these communities.

They may not be buzzing with activity like your grocer’s store. But the associations you hold do effect the choices you make. Hence while designing a space, it matters. Every space needs to be built around an idea, a social group, or an individual, else they will choose to continue in their own bubble, and business will not flourish. Privacy in exchange for belonging, and vice versa. An observation in the book, “The Shock Doctrine” by Naomi Campbell shares the September 11 tragedy of the world trade center twin towers. The idea of a plane crashing into a building was so filmy that you could pass it off as a bizarre movie trailer. But when told that it is really happening puts the mind in such a state of shock that it feels the event caused awe. This emotion of awe freezes the sense of judgement and anything that you throw at such a mind, it accepts. This phenomenon can be applied to positive effect.

In most scenarios of urban scale because the crowd mentality will further blur the clarity of an individual mind. As an architect, you can lead people from shopping districts to food courts, where they feel nurtured because the mind at this point needs a break. Once they have feasted, the resting mind will need activity which can be provided in forms of events. These events are absorbed beautifully by the mind and to memory. If you give them open, public but semi private spaces of urban scales now, your user groups will ponder well enough to bring about positive realization and inspired action. Experiences are important, but how would you conceptualize them? I think of spaces as an emotion. The way you cringe when asked to walk down a narrow alley way. And the way you feel awe surge through your being when you reach an open field at the end of it. You can bet on a plant to act more of a landmark in that field, or you can inspire absolute freedom of thoughts where people can run free. A stump of the tree can bear negativity in the thoughts of this populace, because of the negativity that harbors the process that went into the creation of the stump.

So you can see that energy is passed on through spaces, by virtue of the emotions that create them. I began taking notes on people when I joined Tinder as an app. The sheer overwhelming number of new faces that I met on a regular basis led me to see patterns. As a rule, Tinder is an app made with the intention of increasing meetings and social interactions in this highly behind the screens world of ours. Human nature as a basic form governs that most human activity aims at propagation of the species. But the opportunity to understand the patterns was not ignored. So, here’s what I did. Although the app’s website has kept it’s purpose vague, there is more to what can be done with it. The idea here is to improve your own self. So as to create a better understanding of human comfort.

If you ever head out to meet a match, do not go home first. Instead, take a cab ride to any 24x7 open public space. The presence of the cab driver will ensure safety, and a decent conversation that breaks the ice. Conversations that revolve around a person’s life history do get boring once you have to tell your story to most of the people you meet. It is important to not ask the same questions other people are asking each other. Because now the conversation forces a need for new answers, a new story, and better questions. Conversations should not revolve around popular trivia. E.g., Books, music, movies, etc. This is helpful because this experience stays memorable. No one has revealed any personal information, hence privacy has been protected. Yet the need to share has not been satisfied.

What works though, are those conversations which revolve around the events of the moment. This takes real work. Most people are rarely present in the moment. They spend their time skimming through the past and the future. But meeting people to practice presence of mind to be funny, macabre, or whatever you feel you are lacking serves a purpose. The ability to create helpful information from objects, and situations, in your environment to solve problems. If you have ever been to Times Square or Marine Drive, you will find people staring into space, groups minding their own business. No one ever bothers you with, “Hey man! What are you doing?” People seem to understand. But they are all quiet. But have you noticed that when large crowds assemble at a concert, they start singing the lyrics when the artist pauses for a moment.

It is all for one purpose — to russell. “Roads have given us a lot, but they have also taken a lot from us.” — The National Geographic Documentary on Pozuzo. I heard these lines on a National Geographic Documentary when I was 9. These words have stayed with me since. Travel is often a disconnect. Most of us find it as a means to escape our routine. It is healing in sense because when the mind does not have a routine, it tries to occupy itself within the limits of time. The sudden availability of time reveals to us that there is so much more to life than what we had thought. The freedom tends to render most of our priorities as trivial. The idea of a cab is in, “3 is a crowd, but 2 is company.”

Most of us divulge from striking a conversation with the chauffeurs. This action allows us to zone out in the midst of a transit. And if we have company, then we often tend to involve ourselves in deep conversations about things that seem important or trivia to our lives. Most often, the strongest bonds between two people are formed in travel. The second strongest bonds are formed when one of them has a bad cold. For strangers, the idea of being in a cab, provides a sense of comfort and security that is a direct effect of the presence of the chauffeur. It lets people talk about things that are socially acceptable. And then when they are off the cab, it gives them context and information to build upon. Walking is a subjective experience. While for most of us, walking ensues the focused goal of getting somewhere.

That’s fast walking. But the opposite behavior of taking a stroll, has a very calming foreseeing effect to it. Some high performers, take a stroll to curate their minds with a walk. The process of taking a stroll gives us all the time and pace to jog through our thoughts. It gives a clarity to our past experiences, and lets us zone out into those to figure better reactions that we could have made to those, or in some instances, take a closer, deeper and better look at what we are up to. Walking pours in clarity to an extent where the only things that matter to us can be recognized. Walking with another person can create a bond with them. It can be a setting for providing another perspective to the matter at hand. At the same time, it can give clarity to some concepts that we hold. If done on a regular basis, walking can help us share stories and abstract specific behavior patterns, likes, dislikes of another person.

Walking in a group of three is often brisk paced than the other two instances. The joy of such a walk is in the quick sharing of information that comes with the process. Because the time share is now split into 3 parcels, everyone is more aware about the thoughts they run. This consciousness brings to them a heightened filtering of the clutter. The process then brings clarity to the most personal thoughts and spill out the rest.

**Spooning**.

How I wish to spoon, 
And massage her back, 
At the same time.

How I wish to spoon, 
And grab her ass; 
At the same time.

How I wish to spoon, 
And feel her hair;
At the same time.

How I wish to spoon, 
And kiss her neck; 
At the same time.

How I wish to spoon, 
And find her a robe; 
At the same time.

Oh! How I wish to spoon, 
And tear her clothes; 
At the same time.

But spooning be not good, 
Coz’ my vision will blur out; 
At the same time.

But spooning be not good, 
Coz’ my fantasies will come out; 
At the same time.

But spooning be not good, 
Coz’ I will fall in her arms, 
With the same joy.

Asleep.

**Startup culture**.

Start ups are businesses that are still figuring out:

1. Who their customer is?
2. What purpose they serve?
3. How do they make money?

**The lyrics.**  
“The moon is out,  
I wake up to the morning star;  
standing in the mirror.”

“Those greedy eyes,  
are calling out my name;  
like the crystal bells I hear.”

“Sing a song,  
or do the thing;  
pull me out of this spell.”

“Step right in,  
you are home;  
says the gates of hell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,  
pull me out of this spell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,  
pull me out the gates of hell.”

“I hear the wind,  
he’s preaching now in my ears;  
framing hell in my spine.”

“Behold the truth,  
emerges in a different light;  
fallen angel in disguise.”

“Call someone,  
let me take a pill;  
pull me out of this spell.”

“Step right in,  
you are home;  
says the gates of hell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,  
pull me out of this spell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,  
pull me out the gates of hell.”

“He told me,  
I could follow my heart;  
and forget all my despair.”

“Let the blood-thirst beast,  
invite me in;  
right into his lair.”

“Step right in,  
you are home;  
says the gates of hell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,  
pull me out of this spell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,  
pull me out the gates of hell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,  
pull me out of this spell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,  
pull me out the gates of hell.”
