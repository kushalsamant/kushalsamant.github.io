**Anthologie - Type T**.

**Taking chances**.

So trying to record this right now and it is very easy to do this. The aim is to talk for a minute about anything and keep repeating this process and keep posting to typewrighter that's all. Surprisingly the Google input keyboard works better on typewrighter than any other place that I have seen so far. so original there was thinking of posting an app like Instagram and then copying it to typewrighter but then the word limit was an issue for me also that was hard for me to spend time on moving things around from one platform to another. So now I am being a bit smarter about it and publishing only as much as I can see on my screen so the screen becomes my page. this helps me to know that every article a post out here is one page or something like that but it lets me not over talking to an article because I want to create at least about 100 thousand articles and that is what I can achieve if I spend 100 thousand minutes on this. Considering that everyday is about 1440 e minutes I can then achieve my goal in about hundred days. I understand it is a bit far fetched as a goal. But if I put in the work then I will not have to work so hard for money in my life again and again as a freelancer.

**Tata**.

Sometimes I feel Sir Ratan Tata was right when he said,

“…as you grow in your organization you will find that you get lonelier, and lonelier, and your decision is eventually a lonely decision. You should what you believe is right. It maybe the tougher decision, it maybe the tougher option. But if deep inside you know that it’s the right decision for the right reasons not for the wrong reasons then you should go ahead and take it, and I would hope that you look at being ethical and holding the value systems which you want this country to have…”

**Tattered**.

“Those men who roam in tattered clothes are often the ones who make sure that the cities have plenty to eat.”

**TBC travellers journal**.

So now this bad boy is called The TBC Travellers Journal. But I made some changes in their original package. Now, with one notebook instead of two, and two pouches instead of one, this handcrafted beauty holds a blank notebook with two permanent bookmarks inside, all my cards, cash, IDs, and passports. I bought 3 unipin pigment ink pens - 0.05mm for those fine lines, 0.2mm for those normal lines, and 0.8mm for some heavy weight sketching. Although, there is a penholder on the side, I hung two of these on an antique metal clip (comes from TBC); ah! That's where my boarding pass goes.

TBC engraved my name on leather to make a custom nametag; you know for those days when you find this arsenal being lost, and have to bring it home? I am never carrying a wallet again. The original TBC package lets you opt for 2 blank/dot grid/ruled notebooks. I think TBC has this in Black, Brown, Tan, Full Yellow Rickshaw, Yellow & Black Rickshaw (this one), Green, Pink & Green, and oh my! This is a midori, a passport holder, and what not! You should check it out! @theblackcanvas_

Remember - Nothing boots as fast as pen and paper.

**10k walks.**

Some miles are worth counting,
With endless silences around,
But the chatter never seems to stop,
When you find a beauty,
To ravage, and rage the crown.

**The best part**.

Trying to see if you can create something from scratch or if you want to make something of your own company or something or maybe you might want to go take a job, the best thing to do is to you get an internship. it might not be easy to get a full time job but if you get an internship then you will be able to apply at the same office for a full-time position or like more stories go they will hire you because they trained you and when somebody trains you they will ensure that their efforts continue serving their best interest. So pick anything and stick to it. Experience counts more than education in today's world. And advantage of having internships it's that you can do two jobs at many places because you will work from home and you will get paid for the same which means you will make a much higher collection of money than if you take a full time job at one place.

**The best way**.

The best way to miss a person. The best way, to capture a person. Is in a book; to capture their soul, and all memories. Who do you miss the most? and who else? and who else? There will be a time, for missing you too; until then, Rest, until then. Today, a lot of things changed, for you, and I;, and for the world, in a sense. Let alone the past, locked itself, out of all bounds; and an era of pain, until you ask for forgiveness.

**The changing point**.

After following through the process, most of us might find that the dreams we were following or dreaming about are based on a pseudo wannabe idea of acceptance.

By the way, three things:
- Start companies back to back.
- Don’t worry about the next move until someone shows interest.
- Essentialism is a good thing for routine. But not for creativity.

**The daily average**.

The daily average is at Rs. 25 now. I want to push it further up. Also now, since the team at Typewrighter has improved the interface, making it easy to type, and use all the functions given here - these articles are my personal journal entries. 

So all the best if you are going to be a part of my messy life. I don't care about who knows these details, because well the surveillance agencies knows it all anyway, so duh! 

I have spent quiet a many years on dating sites, and I have always been cheated upon. With people asking for a break to figure things out, and then going on to find someone else, while telling me that there are no overlaps in all of that time. Some things hurt you know. Especially when they happen more than twice. I don't know if there is a flaw in me, I can't tell if I gravitate towards such negative experiences, or if these experiences gravitate to me. Anyway, no matter what the truth might be, it is important to remind ourselves that being supportive is the best way to solve all of our life problems. 

Letting go is an art that I might have mastered so far, but the art of not being in the spot, where you don't have to let go, where people choose to stay by your side, is something that I am still getting lucky at.

Love.

**The Dark Knight fantasy**.

This week I got asked a couple of times by the folks at UN, and a few other friends. A pretty simple question. And note that the mere appearance of the question does not make it simple.

“Why do you support Trump?”

I never followed his speeches. I never knew his history, and I don’t watch the news except when UN Wire requires.

Honestly I know as little about Trump as I know about your dinner last night. No clue. But I blinked. The way Malcolm Gladwell puts it. I saw a millisecond snippet of Trump somewhere, saying “He does not want war.” And to me that was enough. Everybody is at war. Americans being the best at it. Not at war games, but at making war. And when a man stands up to say that he will do exactly what his country is not known for doing right. I will stand by him.

Donald Trump has strange ways. He might be the biggest loser. For none of what will follows from today will help him win on the inside. He has angered a part of his countrymen to overpower him, even before getting to power.

While we all sit here, and wonder how comic American news gets as days pass by. He is working. He is not working on fighting other countries. That means no more conflicts, no more climate change from conflicts, and vice versa. Resources for Africans, and no more trouble for UN Wire.

“You know what he is working on? “

He is working on the inside. He is working at cleaning up. He is being a janitor. He has always been a janitor. And trust the sense of business that says,

“Those who make money are not the ones with the best product out there. Rather the ones who are willing to do what others will not. The ones who are industrious while others wish to be lazy. And the ones who charge for industry.”

Donald Trump must be Bruce Wayne, when it comes to the resources at hand. In my opinion, this chap must love Batman. Not for the glamour or the resemblance. But for those lines Commissioner Gordon said to Foley.

“No help will come from outside… A city must rise on it’s own.”

Donald scaled this thought to his whole country. Both his grandparents are German, Mother’s from Scotland. Boy oh boy! He is a trained perfectionist with all that scottish resourcefulness. And with military discipline he picked up at his army school to go along with it. He’s an introvert, and relentless. No matter what we say, he is a republican with democratic ideals, and followers. He is a nationalist, and he is working on it. Divulging every bit of thought he can scrimmage through the blunders. Every resource he can find to build his country. And that’s a rare mix of self indulgence to be found in the world.

“And I feel it is an Illinois thing…”

Does he not remind you of Robert Moses? Lee Iacocca? President Kennedy? Every time I look at Donald, he looks like those proud Americans from the 70’s. An image of those Republican funded movies, that glance right back from Lee Iacocca’s books on the automobile industry. Back then Detroit in the state of Illinois was known to be the world headquarters for likes of Henry Ford, and American Motor Companies. These are the same people who went on to build machines like the Ford Mustang. Things we cherish. And they played pride at it’s best. They made money off us. These are the same people who put money into building New York with Robert Moses.

Yes, the shitty piece of urbanism that is New York with all those clover leaf concrete patterns of road slicing the city fabric like a knife in a cake. The New York you celebrate. The New York the New Yorkers secretly hate.

“How? Self funding they call it. Just like Trump’s presidential campaign.For what reasons? National Interest, rather the nationalist’s interests.”

Lee Iacocca from Detroit said the same thing. The Ford Motor Company rivalled against Japanese car manufacturers. All of these people have had the same rivals“ — Japan, and China.”

Even for Donald. Illinois you see. Written all over it, in big black Chevrolets. That’s what they have done, will do, and never stop there. Industries that pollute our world, and ideas that make a big mess of urbanism. See my friend, all causes apart. For us the thing that holds value is the American industry minding their own business. Donald Trump is doing just that. His focus is on cleaning the mess that a long line of predecessors have left behind. Somewhat similar to what the Indian premier is upto. Maybe this is just a thing about the age we live in. Maybe the Chinese can tell you the whys, with this monkey year they figured. And in all this thoroughfare, they will forget about us, and they will rise up to their own little bubble.

“And with all pride cometh the fall.”

As history has shown us, just like Ford, Moses, and the rest of them. They shall crumble. So don’t you fret. I am support my country. And it took a lot of a time to get here.

“To believe that all work is done pre-season.”

**Tuesday, November 8, US Presidential Election 2016**.

Creativity is to be played on a mind map, not a time map. Deliberation is not the means to achieve most of what life offers. I want to publish everything I have that helps others be better at what they do. Thinking of it I might be reliving the same mistake of trying to get people to get better — to help them help themselves gets me nowhere. I should leave that to Anthony Robbins. I remember when I was learning to ride. I was kickstarting the Vespa, and then I found myself doing the whole exercise for what felt like 5 full mins. My dad said this —

“Just do it, you are thinking too much.”

It did not take half a kick to start that scooter after listening to that. I need to empty my mind. Most of this list making, and following up we do is the best example of how humans have continued to live in the past. There is some addiction to linger ourselves in that space, and analytics — Why don’t we ban the word from our vocabulary? There is no apparent reason to make a list, take a picture, for creating more physical waste to harness our nostalgia. I can take this idea to the extent that if fully applied, the planet will need no more saving. Live in the present. Use bookmarks. So that when you return to things — this means everything from actual bookmarks to the ones on your browser — you will rediscover from your past. I swear don’t you go on adding my Medium posts on your Keep for reading later. Bookmark, don’t collect. Humans have been hoarding things since times immemorial. This is you. This is your free planet. Now imagine this on a globe. If there is something you really need, you know where to find it. You need to live light. Not just travel light. Some pun clarity.

There is no point taking coconuts to Jaipur from Kerala because you think you may not find them there. You just need to look for it. I am sure Malayalees are everywhere.

Malayalees are humans. So humans are everywhere. You will find things for your survival wherever you go. Unless you are Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton. You might complain about the time, and money you have to spend on travel if you don’t carry your turtle pack. But trust me, you use the things from your dearest turtle pack because you have those things around.

Let me ask you a question. How many times have you borrowed a laptop or an iPod or an iPad or anything else that you might carry in your turtle pack from some random stranger on the street? Have you ever? Hmm… Really? So now you know, you can leave the house with just the keys, if you need to get back in. Most of the times, there will be someone to open the door, right? or if you are living alone you can hide it under the pots. Although I will not recommend pot.

If you think I am crazy, and everything else is so much important, everything else on your list is either a distraction, an addiction, or term it whatever you may — everything else is a space changer — excuses for our mind to distract ourselves. All of these things help you focus. You will not burden yourself with things you don’t need, which means Dhan Te Nan! — Room for more experiences — Te Na Nana! What did you learn from the previous sentence? When you begin something, finish it. Beginning things you really do not want to finish are half the reasons of sorrow, and anxiety in your lives. Similarly, do not finish something because you had begun them. May it be a shitty book, a bad relationship, or your bank account. I would suggest close the bank account, and try something you can manage. The focus of all life should be long term happiness. Not spending time on activity speculating or hoping that things will get better. Hope is by the way a loser’s word. Action. Not thought. Ultimately matters. I know The Secret defers — but has anyone seen The Minority Report? There is a quote that stuck in my mind from Leonardo DiCaprio’s latest production on climate change “Before The Flood.”

“The politicians sway to public opinion.”

To me, this not only means that we can now control the politicians, but also that this idea applies everywhere. If I leave the house with only the keys, I will stop using half of my resources. That means my impact flows to consumption, oh those stupid adverts — I cannot imagine someone wakes up every morning to make the media crap on Indian television — marketing, production, and even the raw material. Imagine the farmer lives you could save if you only carry your keys. For you, this is a conscious decision. You will have to make it.

You know why? My happiness is not betting Biryani on who will be next U.S presidential candidate with my guests. It is not talking about on how Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or gay rights or feminism or the next Flipkart Big Billion Sale matters. My happiness is simple. My happiness lies in keeping the planet alive so that your children can make better talks.

**“After.”**

**Tuesday, November 8, US Presidential Election 2016**.

My dear Americans,

While I lay here emptying my fridge because my country chose to make an economic shift, pondering for years maybe but an all in one night for us, Just like those surprise tests you guys love — appalled at the way your past is still trending on Twitter. It may be what you did not choose for. Knowing fully well that choosing the lesser evil is often a sad day. And please don’t weigh the opinion of 1 country against the troubles of the world. And the collective world is in the moment very real.

But there are a few things you could feel bright about:

Everything I write about here is hard, just as every thing in life is. Obama is still in power. Trump-age, and stampede is some months away. Working yourself up on social media, and the world with these juvenile antics will do no good to anyone.

Especially not yourself. Let FOX or whoever you trust spread the news. Tweeting about negative stuff spreads needless fear. Not anything else.

I don’t know how your country work, but collectively you can clean up. Call for a re-vote if you can convince the other sane side for it. Or go the french way. Just say ‘No.’ How to do that? Watch ‘Pink’ for clarity. Or learn from your own history?

> “The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history.”  
> Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

To be honest, ignore all of that. Pause. The only thing that will matter is nothing. With the entirety of business, and life coming to a slow pace to a near halt for a few weeks because of what my Prime Minister did. But there is so much chaos here, even on normal day, that panic is not something that will ever start in India. That’s given. We know that this will pass, and so do you. So, I spent my day thinking about what is it that I really want to do all my life? And I found not one answer with a because to it. I want you to know that the things that matter the most are all inside you. — your mind, your body, everything that you cannot control. Not another. — Not another person, not another country, not another reason. Not your guns. — Not your money, not your capability, not your nothing. It is happiness, not worry. So take the time, look inside. I know it’s hard to do that in the face of harder issues.

But slow down a bit, and work on yourself. I pray you will soon see clarity like these lines, not cluttered paragraph at the beginning of this post. If you still feel bothered then imagine that you are the only person on our planet. And yes the way you imagine the planet will give you all your answers.

**Social Shifts In India**.

I am aware of the fact that with the measures taken by the Government to end black money, the commons are suffering by the lot.

**Effects**.

- Sourcing money.

This could be anybody’s everyday story, waiting on their time in a queue. Most people who would use cash regularly, have moved on to online wallet apps like MobiKwik, Paytm, FreeCharge AND PayUmoney to avoid waiting in long queues at the banks. The banks seem to have chosen to violate their terms of service to the customers by keeping 24 hours ATMs shut. Should the banks not need RBI Circulars, and a corresponding change of operating protocol notice to be issued to their customers. Whether I am legally correct or not, the banks fucked up their customer service.

- More cars.

This change has made it necessary for most citizens to start an early day to attend to queues. Small businesses that serve overseas markets will find a change of routine as the early start has shuffled wake-sleep routine. Also commuting is difficult without the availability of cash. Only commuters with a seasons ticket or a prepaid Smart Card can use the Mumbai Suburban Rail Transit System. The other options are Uber or Ola Cabs. The major effect that moving 1.2 billion from a cash heavy parallel economy to a cashless economy is documentation. 1.2 billion people have to sign up into wallet applications when the first worry on most their minds is surviving a season. Advent of wallet applications also bring many email receipts to your inboxes. With 1.2 billion people to serve on routine for such documentation, Google will need to provide for more space soon. And people might demand for free space since they have been shown a way of surviving by spending less due to the deficit of paper currency. The Kaali Peelis, and the auto rickshaws part of the transportation industry might join these taxi companies, or migrate to another kind of trade. Those who cannot afford the migration will be a good customer base for the education industry.

Vocational training, and education will have more demand to enable a smoother transition of the massive unemployment scenario that develops. As we promote intra city motorcar transit, we are polluting collectively as a society.

- Changing diets.

Most small business, restaurants do not have a pay by card system. So the choices we make in the morning have been split in two: coffee or ATM. Most of us cannot buy cigarettes because of the lack of a pay by card system. This might mean lesser sales for ITC in the coming quarters. Probably even a drop in prices of tobacco products, if they choose to not siphon the difference. Either ways, we shall experience a healthier population. Have you observed that for ordering a margherita pizza on Zomato, wallet apps offer to pay you a higher cash back percentage. Being vegetarian is a way to riches. I am unsure if this is intentional or circumstantial, but chances are that people might switch to vegetarianism for reasons of money, if not climate change. This may nullify our collective pollution.

**The Sunshine**.

“Indian services need to go online to push the currency deficit to a paperless economy. There are many benefits of doing the shift, and a need for innovation.

- Finding bigger markets.

The opportunity lies in making applications. Applications that cover our lack of infrastructure required in a cashless economy. We should learn from the ways vegetable vendors run their businesses in these tough times. An app for vendors would make life easier for everyone. Facebook will make sense in this context. To give you clarity with a set of prospective areas, think farmers, tourists, chaiwalas, tapris, auto rickshaw drivers, trains, and the rest of us who love filter coffee everyday. Think of everyone we have never met, and those of use without a bank account. These are markets right here.

- Support the tourists.

Opportunity lies in making life easier for travellers. Wallet apps in India do not let you sign up using any mobile number with a foreign country code. Wallet apps do not allow use of foreign bank accounts too. If you are a foreign national living on forex money in India, you are pretty much screwed because of the deficit. Opportunity lies in serving people stuck in these circumstances. One way is to assign an Indian SIM card, and loan money to their wallets. There lies a business idea right here.

- Save on taxes.

Wallet apps do not require you to own a bank account, this means that you can accept payments into any wallet app, and manage life better. Families, and businesses can save a lot of tax by using one bank account, and many wallet app accounts. They could pay their employees via wallet transfers.

Lesser tax filings for the employees. I agree that the government might collect lesser tax in the coming years by giving way to these apps. Looking at the situation from a broader perspective, no more paper, lesser logistical costs will lead to a smaller carbon footprint. That’s more value in it for everyone.

India has forced her citizens to go cashless. You can curse the current Government or take sides with them. But the government has done what most probably is the best thing a government can do to curb climate change. A simple change that make people conscious, and rethink about their habits, what they own, what they use, their behaviours, patterns, et cetera. With a rise in awareness for a cashless economy, the value of the Indian Rupee will soon surpass the US Dollar, the value of the Indian Rupee will equal that of time in the financial capital of India.

**The highest task**.

I hold this to be the highest task for a bond between two people: that each protects the solitude of the other.

**The idea of sharing**.

Today I was talking to a very influential community host. I have always wondered about the ability a non profit might have in functioning without any hindrance. Hindrance from things like funding, and laws. I have always wanted to be someone who draws up a list of people who need shelter, and just go build it for them. More of, “Do you want a house?” — “Yes!” — “Tell me where do you want it, and I will build it for free.” I understand that this must be an architect’s fantasy. Maybe, I am dreaming. But after having zigzagged over commercial, residential, and pro bono projects, I have come to believe that there is peace in it.

I must have been sleepwalking when I did not see the obvious merits of the Corporate Social Responsibility law that they passed back in April 2014. It allows anyone to seek funding from those who are now legally bound to share 2% of their profits towards social causes.

I could have opened shop as a not-for-profit organisation, and got done to work. Instead my focus had been on doing so without any external funding.

Walking either path is equally hard. The not-for-profit one, more so. I have always spent a considerable amount of my day reading up on the for-profit section of our economies. Since 2006, that’s almost 40% of my life on the planet. So now a transition has to be decided upon, and a transition I have no idea about.

I am stumbling upon certain articles that talk more about the who than the how or why. Information on social enterprise seems to be guarded. I wonder why. The idea of sharing, and the idea of sharing ownership are entirely different concepts.

The former a pain, the latter, a relief.

How hard can be getting funding from CSR be? My friends say that it is either begging on a corporate doorstep, or building a brand on Instagram — the idea of being interesting enough for people to invest in your endeavours.

Maybe social norms prefer what exists — but personally, I prefer CSR funding without having to ask for it, just because there is a law that states it will be available for my social cause.

**The joy of not wearing a seatbelt**.

Today, I travelled in a local train. 
My mind went out with glee. 

Today, I travelled in a local train. 
Six months later you see. 

Today, I travelled in a local train. 
I enjoyed the crowd. 

Today, I travelled in a local train. 
Emptied my mind aloud. 

For six months, I took an uber. 
To travel in the city. 

For six months, I took an uber. 
To save some money for me. 

For six months, I took an uber. 
For hours in traffic. 

For six months, I took an uber. 
How crazy can that be. 

For an year, I worked on a project. 
No, not two or three. 

For an year, I worked on a project. 
A dream since I was sixteen. 

For an year, I worked on a project. 
I am now in the core team. 

For an year, I worked on a project. 
I cannot believe. 

The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. 
Feels wild, and free. 

The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. 
Feels like a local maybe. 

The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. 
Opens the mind for me. 

The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. 
I might meet god instantly. 

P.S: The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. Try it only in a train.

**The key to money**.

Do you know what the key to wealth is?

Like I mentioned in the previous article the key to banking is spending your money in the right places. I am sorry I could not make a build up for this article or the answer. but the whole idea of not hiding things from you and giving it to you ASAP is sort of in my DNA. it is funny how you always think that saving money is the key to having more wealth. But that is not true.

Saving money only leaves you with a lot of money that might have face value but it will not have its place value because inflation is a thing. investing money on the other hand is a defence against it it is more like a hedge like a hedge fund is. so if you invest your money in places where its value keeps increasing for example property, gold, actually not gold, but you get my point. 

Debt funds are also a good place to go but I don't think the markets are safe enough the volatile so I think it is better to have a system of your own in place. So instead of having to go to the banks for money or maybe e trying to invest your money in the existing systems of the markets, I think you will do yourself a favour if you give money or rather spend money in your local economy so that your social structure and your social support system helps you count on the people around you which is more emotional in nature than transactional.

If you build a place for yourself in this world in which every time you have ever on gets spent on the people around you like the local rikshawala the local grocery store and people in your community then you are basically actually creating an emotional network of resources which will come to your help whenever you need to get something done that is key to exigencies.

As and when I had thought that saving money was the ki I was wrong so I might be wrong in this regard to but I know for the fact that money comes to those who spend it in the right places because it might come back for example in the form of returns or in the form of social help or in the form of say products or things that you can use.

Money is nothing but tool to get the things you want and which enables you to do the things you want to do in your life. Now most people look at money as an asset but money by itself is not an asset. It is again a tool that is something I would like you to remember for the rest of your life. It is as good as a saw is to a carpenter or a screwdriver is to an electrician or wrench is to a plumber.

**The last supper**.

There are moments of surprises that dot our lives from eventful days to dinner dates. There are a few things that make an impression leaving an insight behind some that span a night or last a lifetime. Most of where we go depends on where we want to be. Learning to keep secrets with liars might be the safest bet or may not be. But the easiest wish to fulfill is to ask for a beautiful life for, for life, that’s a default way to be. Simplicity then is not a habit but what you see in every thing, everything for the future, and every thing that has been. Then everything around you grows in the life just got lucky way. This is how you give life meaning.

**The locus of all focus**.

There isn’t much that we don’t know about life. There has been a lot that is written on it. Very little read. The idea is to read a book a day, try a new meal a day, do the only thing you love for a living, scrap all other plans, and write. Simplicity then, is not the key, it’s the only way to do things right.


**The railroad To Tinkamentown**.

The railroad to Tinkamentown was selected in Cityscape Article Writing Competition 2012, and published by The National Association of Students of Architecture.

Why are gutters grey, and waters blue.
The skies a hue, and the seas so true.
If I could travel, my city anew.
In trains the locals call, locals too.
I rush to the station, the hue, and cry.
To catch my train, at 8.45.
I’ll be travelling down, memory lane.
The faces in the train, say deja vu.
As the train leaves, for terminus.
I find my city, already up.
Across vashi’s bridge, and central mall.
It crosses charles’ lil island, to mankhurd stop.
The crowd now shows, its real strength.
Increasing in numbers, at every stop.
Inside the train, it’s a different story.
Everyday a new salesman, shares his story.
People line up, at the doors.
As kurla arrives, the crowd soars.
The busiest stop, on the central line.
Where every feriwala, gets down.
The few who stay, have big dreams they say.
To be a bigshot, they crave.
To the fort, they sail.
The places change, names n fame.
From vernacular n local, to what the british gave.
The crowds loses its fervour, in my train.
While the rush at terminus, leaves me dazed.
I begin, to wonder.
Where all these people, come from.
They did not, get down.
From, my train.
Everybody rushes, to their offices.
While I take, pity.
Coz I get to, make merry.
With the dark blue sky, glittering with stars.
Spread across, the 400001.
Out on the streets, looking up, and around.
You never know, what we found.
On the trip, to the hotspots.
Of my city’s, south.
Don’t notice the moon, above.
Coz all I see, is cars.
A mercedes, an audi.
And prolly a bmw, on the prowl.
I came down here, to meet a friend.
But till he is gone, I can watch, the lights dance.
And sing along, to the city’s sounds.
The pretty, queen’s necklace.
Seen shimmering, from the seas.
I see, a lil boy.
Admiring its, eternal beauty.
I pray, and, I hope.
That if, its a foreign kid.
He won’t look.
Down on us Indians.
For all the glory, that we achieved!
I dream, of my city.
As if it was built, by the gods.
My people, show.
Not a gesture, of despair.
Only true faith, in fate.
Ever since, its cradle rocked.
This city, is Mumbai.
Maximum, like a few authors called.
In spirit, and in soul.
Beating forever, alongside my heart.

**There**.

I had always been a kid, popular as fuck. But then I have never had a birthday celebrated by my friends. I have had times when people know it’s my birthday but they don’t wish me instead. Mom included. I spent my 18th walking the streets penniless as students are with two friends who wanted a treat. I spent my 21st in a bus back to university, having four strangers singing happy birthday to me, silently. There is a lot that I want to cry about but you give me hope, you confuse my mind with an eternal elope. I am not sure if I could ever tell you these things. But a part of me thinks that penning this down bears is all the courage that exists, within me. I have been spat on, picked on, beaten to a pulp, some dark memories lie beyond my fear. I have been asked why people don’t trust me here, maybe because I promise things too hard for friends to believe or as impossible as sincere. Thanks for sharing that the other day, I shall remember the butterfly effect as cops caught us for PDA. There is a lot of randomness running through my mind, but you give me a hope, for paradise. I am broke tonight, for the year’s ending you see. I have put all of me, in all my prophecy. Life is sad, without a doubt of joy even though we stand, and stare at blazing fast cars, and the sea. Your laughter is the reason my sadness disappears, there is more to our time than emotions, than relativity. Because every moment seems just right in the beginning, and the best that I can hope for is a constant like thee. There is a lot I have to say, say to you, and share it with glee, but I guess the night is young, I miss you, I miss your sunshine, and eternity.

**The right to share**.

The right to share. I believe this should be a fundamental right. Just like the others listed in our constitution. I know there can be more material thought to be derived from this.

Considering how much can we achieve when we share our resources, and not exchange them against each other. Ask those amongst us who have spent their university years, living in hostels or with roommates. The core belief is that sharing encourages access whereas exchange discourages access.

**The secret to everything**.

Ok, cool! It looks like even if you have a plan: 'you actually don't need a plan, you only need to make one choice at a time', and that's good then because this is a simpler way to deal with stuff.

I sleep on some nights. I am learning how to live a focused life. So I distance myself from the rest of the world, and spend time trying to create things or refining my plans. Since yesterday i have aimed at not making plans. Instead making one move at a time, because life is like chess, and you can get to be wherever you want in 36500 moves, that's 100 years; or 36526 moves if you count leap years.

**The who, not the whats?**.

These folks ask me what the key is to building their career is — what’s the next thing they ought to be doing. And I usually frustrate them by answering with questions: What are you passionate about? What sends you springing out of bed in the morning? What is it that brings out the absolute best in you? What is it that inspires you? What do you want to do for the world? What would you do if money was no constraint?

What do you want to be remembered for? What do you want your legacy to be? Think about these questions — the answer to these questions are all about who you are, and may help you discover what you want to be, and what your next step should look like.

**The writer’s manifesto**.

I think I should write.
Write on Medium
Share Medium on Twitter
And find a riverbank
Pull up a chair on the pebbles
A coffee table for
A small laptop
And keep typing
Not wonder a lot
About what might work out
Or what might not
Maybe carry a kindle
You know how heavy books can get
But books have a soul to them
So now I am an artist
And I want to click a photograph
Write a lot about the photograph
Not a one line caption or two
Something that might make more sense
On VSCO itself
But VSCO is more about the image
Less about the text
I want my life to be confined
To that table on those pebbles
With birdsongs floating around me
And the gushing sound of water
With only a tweet per article
And no other promotion to hoard
My life needs to be in hiding
From the world, and information flow
We are after all creators
Not consumers of the world
We add to life you see
Not steal from it, and run
So all my thoughts are limited
Limited by nature to that table
And all my dreams are realized
With every keystroke that goes unheard
This is a life too easy for me
A life where I have to do not much
A life where money is not my worry
And an escape is all that I crave for
On the earth
So I see chocolate mud
Under my grey shoes
Under a chair of rosemary wood
I wonder of all the things
Your mind can imagine
Can you feel them with the same
Tenacity, and vigour ever
But I don’t care what the world thinks of this
My small laptop keyboard is stuck
I think I should write away you see
About every living soul that I meet
And every moment when I am alive
Here.

**Things**.

The things that are common to you, like windy mornings, starry skies, and old trees; beetles, strawberries, and doorbells; coffee, blue jeans, and summertime… are not common to us.

These are things I design: books, city blocks, city plazas, commercial spaces, event venues, homes, houses, interiors, landscapes, urban design, &c.

These are things I love to do: arguments, assertiveness, being outdoorsy, books, chilling alone in a quaint cafes, cleavage, cooking dinners, dirty talking, eating 2 cheese burst chicken pizzas all by myself, erotica, events, exploring, films, gear, going out for long walks, intelligence, lazing on a cozy bed, listening to music, live music at house parties, meeting people, new information, podcasts, posting my google photos to instagram or VSCO, reliving memories, sex, sexting, sitting in the window seats of trains just for fun, tease, theatres, and writing my thoughts down.

These are foodstuffs I like: I love Butter chicken, Chicken biryani, Indian Chinese. If you want to win my heart then try a lot lot lot of Fried Lijjat Udid Papad. So basically Varan (a kind of dal), Bhaat (steamed rice), Batatyachi Bhaji (minced potatoes fried with mustard seeds, red chilli powder, and turmeric powder), Tup (ghee), Limbacha Loncha (lemon pickle), and Papad. And oh yes! Only salt water fishes like rava fried surmai.

These are things I dislike: being abandoned, afraid of taking risks, bitchy behaviour, cocaine, consumerism, drugs, fake feminism, hoarding, judging people based on their trivia or it's practitioners, lack of empathy, living by default, not reading, people not following up on promises, being pushed, pushed away, and quitting.

These are things that I don't want my girl to be: afraid of taking risks, into cocaine and drugs, consumerist, living by default, not an empath, not a minimalist, not a reader, promoter of fake feminism, and quitter.

These are things that have happened to me: I have been boycotted, spat on, stoned, ambushed, assaulted, stabbed with a pointed object, raped, catfished, and ostracized. Not been shot yet. That's the mean side of things.

But I have also been carried back from a beach, directed, dropped home when drunk, fed, helped, saved, and sheltered. That's the good side of things.

**Think of a white shirt**.

Think of a white shirt,
Fluttering in the wind;
As the fabric jitters,
In sunny chills.

Think of a white shirt,
On deep brown soil;
With blue waters shimmering,
Under a summer sky.

Think of a white shirt,
As seagulls cry;
Echoes of human voices,
On a jetty, or a yacht!

Think of a white shirt,
Polo or not;
As crickets dot the evening,
For those binocular eyes.

Think of a white shirt,
For a silent breathe you wait;
Watch your hearts soar,
As the birds take flight.

**Third approach**.

I believe that the way you do anything is the way you do everything.
So, by that logic, the way I cook Maggi is the way I do everything.
It means that the speed at which I boil the broth is also the speed at which I would do most other things.
It goes to mean that if I rush the boiling process, then I will rush most of the other processes that I do.
And as a result, most of the results in my life would be similar to the results that I get with cooking Maggi.

So, cooking Maggi being a process that most of the common folk do, you can gain an insight on your habits. Of the many prevalent methods, I have observed that I cook it in three distinct ways. The common steps here is to empty all of the ingredients in the pot in the beginning because that how I do most things. The difference lies in the heat (effort), and time.
1. High flame - When you boil the broth on a high flame to turn it viscous faster.
2. Med flame - When you keep at stirring the broth slowly, and on simmer until the water turns viscous.
3. Low flame - When you keep it on simmer, and to let it be. If I don't stir it until its boiling, then the broth tastes better.

What I learnt from these three experiences is that,
1. I can either rush things, and get them done, but they don't taste good for long.
2. I can decidedly go slow, and get things done, but they taste superficial.
3. I can let things be, and let them happen, so that they give me a new experience of their taste.

So the third approach is the ideal way of doing things in life. This is true for Maggi, and relationships as it is for most things in life.

**30**.

But then I don’t want to stop, stop writing poetry, poetry that make that heart, heart of yours beat, beat on a brazen road, road to Eldorado maybe, maybe it’s all a dream, a dream that shall fade, fade away on day 29 or 30.

**This is us**.

This afternoon we were watching "This is us".  
We were talking about the show after keeping it on pause.  
She probably disagreed something in the discussion.  
So she let my hand go.  
So I tried to hold her hand.  
She pushed me away.  
So I asked her what happened.  
She had told me go shower then she would tell me.  
So I showered.  
After shower, I asked to tell me what happened.  
She did not tell me.  
She went into the bedroom.  
I went to check on her a few minutes later.  
She said she needs space.  
So I went back to the living room.  
Then after a while I went to the bedroom to take pictures of the view outside.  
She was sleeping.  
Then while I was clicking the pictures, she beckoned me to come sleep with her.  
We cuddled, had period sex.  
I hurt her biceps when I accidentally placed my arm on them.  
This is the sex in which she asked me to slap her.  
After sex, she went to guest bathroom to clean up.  
I went to the master bathroom to clean up and take a dump.  
When I came out, she was in the living room.  
She was nursing her biceps.  
I asked to help out.  
She said she will handle it.  
She went to the kitchen.  
She got an ice pack.  
She kept nursing it.  
She went to the kitchen.  
She made dinner ke liye chilaa for herself.  
She asked me stand a feet away from her.  
We had dinner together.  
I told her I was staying at my aunt's place tonight and I will see her later in this week. Also I have to pick up my clothes from her place.  
She asked me for a reason.  
I told her that she had been pushing me away, she wasn't communicating, she had asked for space, and that I don't feel comfortable about these reasons.  
She said she would not change her ways.  
I told her that I needed space.  
So she said I can't put the asking for space bit on her.  
She said I am walking out.  
I left.

**3:10 to Yuma**.

I am now going to jot a film because most of my tinder dates have succeeded in disappointing me by showing an uncanny ability at flipping. 

Have you seen 3:10 to Yuma? 

That movie shows a protagonist do things even when he need not have to because he wanted to set an example for his son. And the antagonist willingly martyrs his companions to support the protagonist’s cause. These are the true stories that built a country like America. We should learn from it. And if you think it’s ancient, take Elon Musk for an example: that man says;

“When something is important enough
You do it even if the odds are not in your favor.”

I think it is not his quote because my primary teacher told me the same exact thing. My point being, my city needs a lesson on commitment. So far, as an architect, I am wholeheartedly disappointed in mankind, and angry at everything around me. I think this world needs to be committed like the protagonists of 3:10 to Yuma.

**Time**.

Now I don’t know what you were doing when you picked this up. But you should stop and ponder. There are many reasons why it is essential to cut down the things that we do. Time is a thing. It is an asset only if you do something with it, much like money or any other asset.

Count the minutes. If you notice in this lockdown you would have experienced days go by without realising how much time you have lost. So I very recently found out that if I try to live life like Elon Musk or other people of that genre, then I would literally have to count the minutes. I think this happened because I went to bed early last night and I woke up today morning and have gotten a lot done in the first 54 minutes of my waking day. And I been very woke and aware of each passing minute.

Now this is a state of mind that I find to be really nice. It just tells me that I can achieve a lot in my entire day, more than what I would have achieved on a normal week. As we all know time is relative factor in life, it changes as per our emotional state, experiences, feelings, and presence of mind. ped good changes if you choose to be present in the moment you can also choose to be aware of every passing minute which leads to give you the complete control over your day and the things that you choose to react to or respond to or to pass. You can also then notice how much you can get done more if you keep a track of every minute, albeit not in a literal sense but in a conscious sense.

**Timepass**.

Interestingly the only thing that I assume eats into my time is doing timepass. Timepass not because I don't know where I am supposed to go or what I am supposed to do but because I like to be lazy at times and then I procrastinate and then it keeps building into this bubble of a snowball. And I end up losing a lot of time because I keep thinking. But if only I can stop thinking and start doing I think I will be better off at achieving my goals. It does not take more than a minute for a task. Also if you look at it and if you count the number of things that you are able to do in a day's time, right from brushing your teeth, to washing your ass, to sending that email, to completing a major project, you will see that if you really sit down to finish something then you will achieve it in less than 20 minutes.

**Tipping point**.

So I think around 2018 December, I managed to drive a traffic of more than 18 million monthly unique visitors to my Pinterest account. Now this might be seem like a paid effort but it was an entirely organic deal. I am a freelancer, so i definitely don't like to invest money on things i am experimenting with. The lesson that i learnt from doing this play with Pinterest, was that to win traffic on the internet, you need content. Not good content, not bad content, but a ton of mediocre content for every kind of audience. Instead of looking at audience as a target for you, you should learn to think of yourself as a target for the audience. Be the content they want and people will flock to you. That's no news. It's obvio. It's so obvious that we often assume that everyone must have this in their minds all this while. But more often than not, it helps to bring reminders of obvious things to the table. The trick of the game is to pick one thing, and stick to it. Period.

**To be me**.

The only thing that I have to be is to be me. Not the me the world wants me to be. Not the me my friends want me to be. Not the me my wife wants me to be. The only thing that I have to be is to be me.

**Tonight**.

After being struck in a lockdown for like the past 60 days I think that no matter how much you ask for outside help or to the government or to the police or to anybody else that you know is in power or has the capacity to help you out of this position of being stranded that you are left in, I just think I realised that I have no friends.

Most people have stopped talking to me, most people have given up on the idea of seeing again. Some have ended things because I found shelter in semi Muslim locality. While some just think that I am being reckless by not going home because they don't understand that the government has made certain laws that do not allow me to travel across the district border. and even if I somehow managed to walk across the border then I will not be allowed to stay in my own society because of the stigma that people in that region hold.

Basically I don't know what to do next but I think I will stay put and hope that I can afford to cover rent for this friend of a friend of a friend's place so I still not cause any burden to my host.

So to tonight; my first night in my own city where I feel like a complete stranger being all by myself. This feels very similar to how Kangana Ranaut's character might have felt in the movie "Queen" when her friends leave for their journeys at the club.

**Toxicity**.

The idea here is to get yourself entangled in a mesh of people so that when they leave, they take away pieces of you, and you are left with self-awareness and immunity from pain.

**Trainspotting**.

What the fuck is this guy doing? I am hungry. I need to go home. I need to go home.

**Tu chal**.

Tu khud ki khoj mein nikal  
Tu kis liye hataash hai  
Tu chal, tere wajood ki  
Samay ko bhi talaash hai  
Samay ko bhi talaash hai  

Jo tujh se lipti bediyaan  
Samajh na in ko wastra tu  
Jo tujh se lipti bediyaan  
Samajh na in ko wastra tu  

Ye bediyaan pighaal ke  
Bana le inko shastra tu  
Bana le inko shastra tu  

Charitra jab pavitra hai  
Toh kyun hai ye dasha teri  
Charitra jab pavitra hai  
Toh kyun hai ye dasha teri  

Ye paapiyon ko haq nahi  
Ki lein pareeksha teri  
Ki lein pareeksha teri  

Jala ke bhasm kar use  
Jo kroorta ka jaal hai  
Jala ke bhasm kar use  
Jo kroorta ka jaal hai  

Tu aarti ki lau nahi  
Tu krodh ki mashaal hai  
Tu krodh ki mashaal hai  

Chunar uda ke dhwaj bana  
Gagan bhi kapkapaega  
Chunar uda ke dhwaj bana  
Gagan bhi kapkapaega  

Agar teri chunar giri  
Toh ek bhukamp aayega  
Ek bhukamp aayega

Tu khud ki khoj mein nikal  
Tu kis liye hataash hai  
Tu chal, tere wajood ki  
Samay ko bhi talaash hai  
Samay ko bhi talaash hai

**Twitter X pen**.

My issue with Twitter is that once you drop a message it becomes as impossible to find it again as to find a drop of water in the vast mighty ocean. I have often thought of not enclosing or meddling with the whole social media bubble.

Since my childhood I have noticed that the Internet as made us anew. We have gone from being result oriented peaceful societies, to loud pop culture addicts. And our actions do not hint otherwise. Not a tad bit. So whether I should pick Twitter as my final choice of an online profile should not matter to me with the force that it does. Yes, but not always. At times, help and valuable resources or valid information can be fetched from the Internet. So we need to have at the least… — hmmm actually make that, at the most, — one social media we can be involved with to stay in touch/up to date with the happenings of this planet. I know, this topic is so tiring that I did fall asleep while I pen this. But nonetheless, it was meant to provide me with me some clarity. And it did.

**2000 dates**.

So, I have been on 2000 first dates over the last 5 years. The experience has let me see the alarmingly range of people who are swept away their choices under a lull of popular beliefs. The things that people do, including the way they treat others under a belief of self preservation or self interest mostly has led to believe that nothing is true, it’s all a sham, and no one loves you or anything for anything at all.

The moment you give someone what they ask for, they will feel happy for that endorphins hit, and they will toss you like a used condom and even talk trash about you to their friends. They will do this, even if you have literally saved their lives when they asked you to.

**Type-faced**.

We need to get curious. About everything around us. There might be more things that we are wasting resources on than we know. I am getting into the habit of unlisting, undoing, and decluttering as usual. We need to ask more questions. I started with my phone. With all the files in it. By deleting the photographs that don’t matter, and uploading the ones that I was a bit indecisive about to the cloud. I moved on to clean my bed, and the entire airbnb again. Everything that was not being used will get picked up by the janitor at 9. There is so much that I can sell, so much that can be replaced, so much that can be ridiculed, and so much to save a day. Ideation is often interrupted with the emergence of information.

Information is a nightmare. No wonder ignorance is bliss. True isn’t it? How many times have you caught yourself on reading up on stuff you will never use? Not in the next ten years at the least. But then with the premise that Steve Job’s call about attending the calligraphy class gave us wonderful typefaces is crap. Because most people don’t get to do what they love.

And many more choose not to. If I can get through the ATM hunt ritual of any present age Indian. I will buy a notepad. No, not to scribble on it. But to illustrate the language of drawing.

It is better to carry a book because batteries die. And it is better to carry a sketchbook because not all writing is done outside the mind. We need to be out of our minds, remember? Else the information will swallow us into a bubble.

A bubble that is so clearly visible in the present day American youth. Ideas are to be jotted down, and put to work immediately. Else they lose their time, and be nothing more but listicles. Lists will give you clarity but a workflow will give you productivity. Most people forget this, and keep generating crap. Not in terms of quality, but in those of utility. Have you noticed that most of what human civilization has been upto is to create things that are not, or rather cannot be completely consumed. There is so much garbage in the utility value of everyday life. It is hard to imagine if we can ever succeed at saving ourselves. Truly, the race of man has failed. Let us hope I am wrong. We create more than what we can consume. And we give way even more to ruin. If we take a step back, and pause. We will see where we are heading.
