**Anthologie Type - D**.

**Damage**.

We limit our view of others by the reality we can imagine for ourselves. In my lifetime, I have been boycotted, spat on, stoned, ambushed, assaulted, raped, and abandoned. Not been stabbed or shot yet. I told this to someone recently, and the response was, “All of that screams damage to me.” I hold a different view.

This would have qualified as damage if I had chosen to whine about it. But I don’t remember feeling or doing that. The takeaway here is that we perceive the responses that people may have, based on a reflection of what we would do in a similar situation. That’s empathy. But empathy has a flaw.

Most of us are unaware or not remember often that everyone thinks differently. Thoughts are as different as fingerprints. No one thinks the way you do. That’s what makes us all unique. No one shares the same journey.

No one shares the same resources. No one shares the same stories. Since we don’t keep this one in our minds when we go about our daily lives, we limit our view of others by the reality that we can imagine for ourselves. That’s assuming. But being assuming has a flaw.

Everytime you look at another, remember that what they may pursue as an ideal reaction or response differs from yours. The real stereotypes are the ones we hold about ourselves. These are not a part of what popular culture dictates. But more of what we wish for us, or think as ideal when we are posed with a new experience.
Awareness as such, is essential for happiness.

**Death**.

So here’s what happens when you die
You close your eyes,
and you see it coming
You imagine all the ways within that moment
Of how you can die.

You might be lucky enough
If you are stationary
As in in your bed, and not
Prowling on the streets /outside.

For then there is no action
Or reaction
To concur
That might cause your demise.

If you are lucky
You might see
The exact way
Held in time.

But there is a thing
About the future
It changes
Every time you look at it…

Because
You looked at it
So that’s why
Then you won’t die.

And you know you have won a victory
As temporary as it might be
A victory over death
For this thing happens to thee.

There is one nice little pain in your fingers
Almost like something is pinching inside
But with more nerve sort of feeling
Not an external desire.

That pain makes you want to be alone
Curl like a prawn, and feel your body inside
It makes you want; to be lost in your own thoughts
But then it subsides.

Whenever you have to die
A finger will pain
From that point
Near your palm.

Usually it’s your left arm
For most of your arteries,
And veins there
Go straight to the heart.

And it will wake you up
If you are not destined to die
Or if you have seen the future
Then it changes for you that’s why.

**Delusions**.

I saw Joker. He is a delusional character. He imagined his neighbour to be in love with him. And that seemed to be quite a thought for me. So here are a few thoughts.

Are you real?
Are you my delusion?

Maybe, I am delusional about being in love with you. That's how delusions work, don't they? They are beliefs that you dream on under the name of faith, and hope. They are mostly akin to the emotions of being loved, being wanted, and belonging. They happen under the stress of mundane routine.

Am I real?
Am I your delusion?

But, my story has a routine. It has a pattern of meeting people, and then of them leaving me. The only thing common about these experiences was routine. Do you notice how they leave me, and not the other way around of me leaving them? It's their choice.

I have been going back to back having this same experience for 6 years now. So maybe I am only an idea that exists. That is passed from people to people. Maybe I exist in the human form. But I am only another entity.

Maybe I am not the only one. There are so many of us out there who feel the same way. Maybe we are all but a figment of someone's imagination. A figment of imagination created by routine. The routine of doing things that render me so obvious that other people can't help but take me for granted.

Now being taken for granted is not a problem. It's a sign. A sign that, in some cases, maybe your whole life is not actually happening the way you think it is. Maybe it's only imagination. Maybe this is what the Matrix is.

Maybe that's what Einstein meant when he said, "Reality is merely an illusion. Albeit a very persistent one." The answer to break away is to consciously choose something non monotonous to do. To walk away from monotony. Maybe this is not the real meaning of life. But, a key to make you start thinking consciously and deep about every move you make.

**Diet**.

**Note**: This article is not an advice from a General Practitioner (GP).

- Jeera water is considered to be one of the most beneficial home remedies for gas pain. You can prepare jeera water by adding a teaspoon of cumin seeds in two cups of water. Boil it for at least 10 minutes. Then, let the water cool down.

- One drink that can be made in a jiffy using just three ingredients is of green cardamom (elaichi), cumin (jeera) and fennel (saunf). According to ayurvedic expert, Dr. Ashutosh gautam, "A concoction made using these three ingredients is recommended for bloating. Fennel has diuretic properties, whereas cardamom and jeera both help in relieving gastric distention and are digestive in nature."

- Other than this, boiling one teaspoon coriander seeds in water for 5 minutes and then drinking this concoction twice a day could also be beneficial in keeping bloating at bay. This drink also helps to reduce water retention in the body and makes one feel lighter," adds Dr. Ashutosh.

- Have peppermint and chamomile tea once or twice in a week.

**Dissociation**.

Thanks for writing in. 

I practice something similar to disassociation. I think of it as a strength to being practical when required. Difference being that I do not shut down: I disconnect by conscious choice. I don't know if what I experience is dissociation/not because duh, I am no expert in this field. I don't get to the extreme of not being present in time, space, and reality (this can happen after smoking up). 

I have not experienced a change is perception of space, except once in a 12th standard Math class. I can imagine, or doubt the reality of things, but those are only thoughts. Thoughts that show new perspectives, enable new discoveries, and engage new projects. You will have to show me the difference between, 1. the feeling of emotional emptiness, and 2. numbness. 

I have no thoughts after an art of living meditation course. I can't control this specific thoughtlessness. I have specific type of thoughts, more of curiosity and wonder after smoking up. I can control this specific thoughtfulness. I have always felt my existence, but my general awareness is often absent. I float around through life in my own bubble, as in an empty daze: like a drunk stupor. 

I have caught myself lighting another cigarette right after a cigarette without any memory of the smoking the first cigarette: my forgetfulness. Although I am aware of threat, and I choose to go through with threatening experiences because I value life experience more than living in a safety net: my curiosity. I often see similar behaviors, and patterns in other people. I feel like I am a mirror. Although most of us behave exactly the way those around us do: in contrast, my behavior is the copy of whoever I am engaged in a conversation with. 

I am never empty of emotion, unless I choose to do so for practical reasons: which is again a emotion of purpose. So I am never empty of emotion. My behavior becomes mechanical when I am dazed, or presently since January this year. I haven't caught myself to have any signs of self training to appear normal. I cannot play a game of appearances. 

I have no trouble functioning as a normal person. Or maybe I am so good at appearing normal, that it has become instinctive. My short term memory is very small at time. My long term memory, as I have been told, is amazing. Making notes in a journal helps my cognitive process. 

If I ever feel empty, I fill it up with both good and bad habits. I have observed that this is usually: one bad habit, and the rest of it with many good habits. This mix of habits usually does the trick of bringing me back to recognizable limbo. 

I understand that you have/had issues. If 1. it ever gets bad, or 2. you feel like switching off, or 3. you become mechanical, or 4. you find that your ability to experience or feel emotions is absent, then you can talk to me about it. 

I believe that good communication makes everything better.

**Distances**.

So I have been traveling back and forth cities now. The one thing that I have realised in process is that our perspective about distances change when we travel. For example, a distance between Bombay and Pune of about 122kms in 2.5 hours used to feel like a lot. But yesterday it felt like a place next door. Maybe that’s what globetrotting does to you.

Our take on life changes in direct proportion to the experiences that you expose yourself to. Travel makes superficial everything that would be deemed important that a person who hasn’t travelled often would deem important. Life seems larger than what worries you everyday. Routine seems to blind us to the vast world that lies beyond it. It is funny how millions of us would choose to scurry into routines that seem dull to those who put themselves in situations that are reckless, dangerous, but alive.

**Do you see?**
 
Do you see?  
The mist, and the mountains tonight?

Do you see?  
The wind that blows into the land? 

Do you see?  
How beauty beat age again? 

Do you see?  
The sails that ruin the rain? 

Do you see?  
How sin can be found in the chords? 

Do you see?  
The air that reeks of smell? 

Do you see?  
How grammar changes the thought? 

Do you see?  
The cold in the dark night sky? 

Do you see?  
How bright these city lights are? 

Do you see?  
These things that block out the stars? 

Do you see?  
How no order this song has inside? 

Do you see?  
How quietly can meta survive? 

Do you see?  
It ain’t no fault of thine? 

Do you see?  
Why you should never give up for some wine!
