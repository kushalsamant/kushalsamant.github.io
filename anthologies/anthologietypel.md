**Let me**.

Let me lose myself in you. Behind those knocks on the door and sliding windows. There isn’t a moment I want, without your envelope, the smell of you body, the wetness of your skin, the curves that hold me, under your sheets, from winter nights to summer days, there is barely anything, that I want to not do with you, not want to feel in your company.

**Letters to The Commissioner of Police, Mumbai**.

Date: 15th May 2020

Dear Mr. Param Bir Singh,  
Commissioner of Police,  
Mumbai,  
MH. India.  

I am Kushal Dhananjay Samant. I am a resident at the following address as per my passport records: 6/A2, Shree Hari CHS, Plot-11, Behind Neurogen Hospital, Sector 40, Seawoods (W), Navi Mumbai — 400706. MH. INDIA. I am a stranded individual at the following address at the moment: C/o Satchit Puranik, Flat №14, Tabeer Terrace CHS, Lane Opposite Orchid Global Learning Academy, Versova, Andheri (W), Mumbai — 400061. MH. INDIA. My apologies because I was unaware of the changes in the online application process that were being carried out by Maharashtra Police when I was preparing the following documents for my Travel Pass application as a stranded individual as per the previous form that was available on the website — <a href="https://covid19.mhpolice.in" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">covid19.mhpolice.in</a>. I have followed through meticulously on all tests, and documents required for my travel back home. I am sending these documents for your reference along with this letter.

1. A prescription from Dr. Vernon Miranda to get a COVID19 test done, solely for travel purposes.

2. COVID19 test report from Suburban Diagnostics. My test report says, “SARS-CoV-2: Not detected.” i.e. COVID19 negative.

3. Fitness Certificate from Dr. Vernon Miranda based on this Test Report.

DN Nagar Police Station has quoted, “They have not received any instructions regarding inter-district transit for stranded individuals”. I have been advised one police officer to take an auto (which is unavailable) or take a private vehicle (which no one is willing to volunteer). This ball is now, apparently in your court. The Mumbai Police website — <a href="https://mumbaipolice.co.in/ApplicationforEmergencyTravelMigrant.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mumbaipolice.co.in/ApplicationforEmergencyTravelMigrant.html</a> now deems it necessary that I should submit an RC Book and a driving license as an individual if I have to return home. Do you think that this is preposterous? Because I imagine it to be so. I would like to request you to kindly grant me either of these permissions.

1. Permission to return home by public bus transport or,

2. A letter that permits any auto driver to return home after dropping me home.

I hope you shall support my return. You can reply to this message or contact me on +918779632310 for any queries.
Thanking you very much.

Yours truly,  
Ar. Kushal Dhananjay Samant.

**Life**.

La vida es para dar besos profundos y buscar amaneceres en ciudades nuevas.

Life is to give deep kisses, and seek sunrises in new cities.

**Listening**.

Whatever might be the reason that stops you from doing what you want, it is essential to recognize that the only way you can get things going is by trusting yourself blindly. The most common mistake that we do as humans is to ignore our inner voice, that inkling of a notion that beckons us against something or for something. That inner voice is always correct. It is always the quietest. It is more true than anything that surrounds it.

The key to making better decisions is to de-cide. To cut away everything that you don’t need. And the easiest way to find what you don’t need is to ask a single question. “Do I need this?” And a simpler rule:

> "If the answer is not a clear “Yes!”, then it is a clear “No.”  
> Malcolm Gladwell.

**Listening to myself**.

You know this is an additive process because I have been spending so many minutes on Instagram and other platforms on resuming content and it is pretty addicted to stay on those platforms because well that's how they are designed right. Now considering that I am speaking into the microphone and I am going to get paid for this voice over thing which is basically what you are eating at the moment there is nothing more satisfying than knowing that somebody out there will learn from you and from your mistakes and from your life experiences and will at to their own life all the good things that you have learnt in your life. So listening to me is not addictive enough for me but the knowledge of understanding that I can now make a difference by sharing ideas with the world is something that truly satisfies me as a person and I don't think I will ever stop posting using speech to text on Typewrighter.

**Local economy**.

Do you know what the idea is behind funding local economics? The the full idea why I want to give funding to local economy instead of se a brand as much life in this small top that I was having with this auto rickshaw driver while going back home before this lockdown. So the conversation that I had with him was about how taking a rickshaw back home instead of booking in ola or Uber or maybe going from the public transport was beneficial to everybody in the process. I am aware that you might know I'm talking about it is basically about taking my money and spending on things that are sold by people who have kids to feed and who badly make bye in today's world. The idea of giving out your money and spending it in the right places is the key to banking. Because I am spending it on rickshaw ride I am pretty sure the rickshaw drivers kids would get or would be able to afford a decent education and it will make this world a better place.

Please excuse me for all the spelling mistakes in my articles I am not typing them out I am trying to capture my thought and trying to figure out the next best thing to do for me.

**Lone tree**.

A lone tree standing at the edge of a cliff is not all lost, and lonely. It is what holds the cliff together.

**Lost 1**.

This is a journal entry, not conscious of public discretion, in the now, or the future. I am afraid of the immense activity that I will have to put up with if I continue my not architectural job. I am afraid that I will have to face an existing piece of failure if I quit it. However, none of it let’s me do what I really want to do. The job does not give me happiness or the time to pursue those things that make me happy.

The job does not give me any respite, despite the fact that the place is buzzing with people. The capacity to create would make it so amazing for myself since that is all that I want to do. As my handwriting seems to distract me, I am looking for objects/ ideas, thoughts to build a discretion around. What I want is no attachments binding me around my choices with time. I can write, I love to travel, I love creating Architectural design.

A part of me still doubts my love for Architecture. A part of me fears that there is much value placed on public opinion when deciding the course of action that I take. Often that’s not true, but more often than not, it is. Of this particular behaviour, I will need to be watchful. The best of me has come out in action when my aim, and purpose had not been built upon ideas of “What will look good on me?”.

The best of me had often, and still comes out of the complete disregard of the above idea, and undoubtedly in the forgetfulness of it. The idea of creating for the sake of creating does not make me money even if it may serve the society with no addition of art. I had thought of building a delivery service that’s by the people, for the people, and of the people. The only hurdle here is accountability. Sometimes, I feel lost when it comes to deciding the next best thing to do.

The fact of being alone in my practice, doing everything from measuring sites with a tape, regular visits at a print shop, to handing over the keys to a client. These small essential tasks do not bother me. What has bothered me for almost a decade is unavailability of a person to soundboard. Options that vary from deep design discussions, to choosing what meal to order, or cook for lunch /dinner. I have spent years looking.

Although the dull mood of everyday life makes such relations stagnant at some point, it has taken me quite a lot of time to realise that every individual is alone in their journey. And as you get closer to the top, every decision is a lonely decision. I have realised after tumbling around different industries in the search for a product /services, that the best ideas are often your first ideas. Usually the instinctive step that your mind tells you when you look at a person /thing is the thing to do that will get you the best outcome. Although most of life will ask a different version of you in the various stages of life, you are better off going with the flow.

The plans that we often make are the second best options that are available at hand. Thought is the most delusional aspect of everything. Thought can often lead us to believe that everything has a step by step program. But we fail to realise /consider that circumstances change. That human potential to deal with changing circumstances is infinite.

The power, and nature to adapt is the sole reason why the human race has come so further ahead from the other animal species on this planet. Adaptability is the only lesson here. Executing your first thought or the instinctive idea that comes to you when you look at anything is the best step.

**Lost 2**.

So lost she be,
so lost she be,
in some forest,
outside Dehradun,
I wonder when,
will she be back,
while WiFi does her,
no good.

**Love 1**.

Oh my! oh my!
That value for love she had;
for she never had any.

**Love 2**.

Love is like photo editing. Where you reach a point that you know there is more to be done by your standards, but the picture looks so good already that your standards fail to add to it eventually. Where the details cannot be better, where the thought of your first idea to be the best idea falters. When you have practiced so much that you reach a point where know bliss. Where the only thing that you can take away is; commitment, hard work, and an enduring belief in the present, and a future.

I would have never thought that an unremarkable image would mean a start of something so huge for me. The whole idea behind getting on Instagram was to document my work in progress, or to a certain extent documenting the work that I had done over the previous years. It may be a lot that can be ignored, but every day has so far come to me with a learning experience. The things that are possible in this world that we occupy, and the things that I have used now, and then to create a bright future with all those people who have touched my life. The entire intention now is to dump my personal experiences, and in simpler words, to maintain a journal here.

Not a daily one, but a journal that intends to add words to images, all in one place. So that when they come together piece by piece, I can publish my own book, or maybe fuck that! Creating for the sake of creating. Documenting for the sake of documenting. Leaving it all for civilization to decipher in the ways that time seems fit. The purpose of social media is not to hit a self set number as a goal.

But to continue creating, and sharing a part of you. It is not to assign meaning to your life based on what you see in the life of others. But to see where you stand, and appreciate whatever it is that you hold. Self love.
