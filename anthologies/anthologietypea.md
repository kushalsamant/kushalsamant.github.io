**Anthologie - Type A**.

**A butterfly**.

A butterfly to remind you, that all is not lost. A butterfly that flew by, when you were lost in your thoughts.

**Abyss**.

This picture reminds me of hierarchy. A man looks down on another, while being idle himself. The way this society prides upon its idle-being than those industrious-beings. With the background showing two buildings posing for the shot. Gaudy at their best, aspirational properties for those who lie in the foreground. If you look closely, the worker, and his tools are in the shadows. And the people who owns those posy buildings too. Remember that, all those who win are toiling away in the background. All work happens behind the scenes. The lesson here is that, “All work happens pre-season. Throughout your life you can see that those who are rich are so because they do the things that the majority are lazy to do. The fishermen can afford boats that cost more than your paycheck. The farmers own estate. Thinking about such paradoxes, I wonder if these men working on the foreground, were paid to be here buy the means that own these buildings. It is strange how men have structured civilization in selling everyone a dream, that even adults believe in. I am not against being employed. I am against not compounding my time with efforts that reap in perpetuity. That’s an abyss. Getting through this abyss means going hungry for a decade, and reaping your rewards in perpetual eternity.

**A chat**.

It is just hard for me to find someone who has the same troubles as I do. And then ignore them for the longest while till they fade away into the shadows. I wonder if they can still see me, but I wish they returned. I don’t know how to tell you, show you what I mean, because every time I want to find love, love escapes me. I wish you are well, and achieve all of your dreams, I wanted to write you letters, to all the places that you will be. Do you even like me a bit, is a question that haunts me, leaving me puzzled every night, with calls being cut by thee. It is hard to believe anything at all, with those midnight kisses that you sneak, I wish you were for real coz my heart aches, at the thought of losing something like you and me. I have no clue how we will meet, if we don’t talk till then, there must be a way that you know of, but I ain’t half as smart as thee.

OK are you trying to sweep me off my feet, Because I ll have you know mister That I’ll be a bit heavy for thee.

I don’t mind the weight of thee, when your thought scare me, to be distant, and far away from love in every living bliss. I admire you have a tact for poetry, but sometimes that is what kills, love, and lust, and breds anger forever, in something as subtle as we. Can I have your address? Something where you will always be, even if we don’t meet, and blah blah, that’s where I can write to see, seduce you through my words atleast, if not by my KGS.

There is no tact in poetry It’s just lazy As is everything, Including you, and me, As there is no subtle we. Let me tell you a story, My paths crossed with a guy, Let’s call him dick, He was cute, and all But I am not sure we’d click But now as I write this, I think maybe it’s something, I guess i’ll have it in place of nothing. Write to me …

That’s real address forever.

That seems made up in the eon tonight, just to keep me separate for thee, must be for good, because you wouldn’t have made the effort, of writing a poem back to me.

This is me, from eternity, in the search of an reply from thee, maybe we could write poems, and publish a love story. I agree many have been written in the memory of glee, but let’s make ours stand out of time, with our secret little relationship. Now don’t you go out there, and label, brand our relationship with sex, I am just using the word in a broader sense, and there shall be other things to feel.

I have written a few line of love, disguised by lust in this midnight journey, I hope the reach you, and find you well, or maybe I should just change my metric.

I want to write, a poem a day, it might be shit, but that’s okay.

Let’s write our texts as poems, and publish them on medium, maybe it will work as the bond, to keep us together, and from falling apart. What say of this whispering, that my mind has begun to speak, shall we find each other, and love through the means of poetry.

**A collective**.

I have spent my last three months trying to declutter. I have changed the way I live at least two dozen times. Right from the houses I live at, to my work profiles to my collection of books, my games, my documents — even my bank accounts, and stock collection.

I have noticed that most of the changes in my personal assets make a rare dent in the lives of people around me. I consider this to be a lucky effect of being free. The hardest part of the process was — as opposed to my imagination: everything soft aka online.

I moved content to, and from my laptop, phone, and two 1TB SSD drives. Also, Archinect, Behance, Eyeem, Facebook, Flickr, Freelancer, Instagram, LinkedIn, Medium, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo, Vine, and VSCO.

The idea that I began with was to read/see/listen/learn, and delete. Stuff. The idea was to not hoard anything. Soon keeping things in check became harder, especially with the ever increasing hustle of the 8 odd email addresses I need to manage. As a result, I lost my girlfriend, and a lot of common friends.

I am on a month long break — at least that’s what this is. I have been up nights in a row, trying to keep up with the progress at work from the interns to the architects who work with me. Until one of them had to see a neurologist for reasons undisclosed. It is freakish what the team had been going through. What I found was keeping me insane was this thing I started — the decluttering.

A colleague once told me how her native language lacks gender differentiation — It hit me. The thing with doing away with most of what you own — tangible, and intangible is just a part of the solution. What most of us had been missing out on was our belief in segregation. — the kind of organization achieved by sorting systems into criteria.

The first thing I did was to make a page. Filled in on everything I could in the social media section. Sometimes being open about the blunders that can cost you heavy does you good. My social media lady felt this was pathetic. She believes that apps come with a predefined purpose — for example, she says Tinder is for sex. I disagree. Tinder is to meet people. What you do there after is not of Tinder’s concerns. If a society is branding it as a hookup app, then there is something that should concern you about the said society.

The second thing I did was to dump everything on those 1TB SSD drives. I was sorting files according to extensions, not projects, not clients, not dates. After all, what’s that search tool made for! This did free up one SDD — That’s progress.

The next thing I did was to dump everything on an inventory account on slack. I feel sorry that GitHub has that 25MB upload limit. This has now made all my work cloud based; for free, and for an infinite time. Now since everything is on the cloud, I can live appliance free. I travel with just 1 book in my bag. As far as decluttering goes I have to deal with only one thing — the page.

Since I have made a collective out of my everything, every kind of separation has ceased to exist. Life is simpler — maybe something the Americans can learn from.

This is hard to understand for some of us, but soon you will start to get interesting — something like Twitter.

**A constant medium**.

If you are used to change the medium of publishing in your creative process then you should stop that. Like the mistake I make is to flip from using speech-to-text vs. typing on other projects. If I want to generate good ideas than writing yourself still cuts the mustard by being the best way to get a continuous flow of ideas. Because when you stop speaking, your brain goes about doing something else. Whereas if you are thinking while writing then your brain will be stuck in a loop giving you ideas because you won't change its general sense of direction. Change of work is often considered as a form of break. I know it's hard to believe that. But it is also the most productive ways to create using a different forms of media. As long as your aim dictates that you can slack in your creative process.

**A dating pattern**.

Oh well, I have been on dating apps since 2014. So I have an idea about that.

1. Dating app algorithms give you a match mostly on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Not on Mondays.  
1.a. Most people talk, get close, hookup or get intimate by Sunday.  
1.b. Then the work week begins and you know that your partner lacks somethings. Everyone does. I do too.  
1.c. You get new matches on the Wednesday/ Thursday again.  

1.d. Here's the catch.  
If you talk to anyone new, then you are splitting your attention between two people.  
Your partner will notice this.  
Your partner will do the same.  

1.e. By the time it's Monday, your partner is already with the new person.  
1.f. You get dumped because you are not-perfect no!  
1.g. You sulk until Wednesday/ Thursday, and viola. You have a new match!

P.S.: This is a time mapped problem. If you cut your nails at 1.a., then by the time you have completed the story and reached 1.g. You will have to cut your nails again. :D

**Alone**.

Thank you for the inspiration. It is things like these that make me keep on going even when all the odds are against me, and the future of all my dreams seem bleak. On days when every motion you made seemed to have hit a dead block. These words you write make every moment worth reliving. Honestly, I haven’t read all of your post but the words I picked on when I scrolled down until here gave me enough to wake up from the middle of my sleep, and drag my mind into a pool of wretched commitment.

And I mean no disrespect. All I can say is “You should write more.” It keeps guys like me going. As we feel direct influence, the people of our planet will soon see an impact of your work. Thank you a lot for pulling me out of timid safety.

**Also, on a different note**.

Also, on a different note, I was crossing the Vashi bridge yesterday. It was raining, and these harbour line trains usually sway in the strong winds on that bridge. You could see how everyone around the big doors is anxious. It's as if this train ride might be the last moments of your life. But the rain was beautiful. It was so scary that I thought that if everything you wanted becomes true, every thought you have had will come true, then I would want to think of living or just being alive. In that moment, I realized this: Everybody must have had a bad day, but not everyone was mulling over it. Some of us in the train were, not worried, or blank, or just being happy. Being happy was not something that happened to anyone of us, it was a choice these happy faces made. In the same way as worrying was also a choice I made. It was as intense as the choice to live, when those winds last night scared all of us in that train. So, staying happy needed our conscious attention, just like anything else in life.

**A mind that creates**.

> "Lose an hour in the morning, and you will spend all day looking for it. "
> Richard Whately.

This is a journal entry on routines, and behaviours that come from people who are successful in different walks of life. E.g. The 4am club. I am a stern believer that the miniscule things that we do everyday amount to a lot in our life. If you have read James Clerk’s thesis on the Pareto principle, you will find that to the 1% of the world who happen to be winning at life, winning doesn’t happen. Winning is created. Curiously carved, over a long period of time. Waking up at 4am is an easy thing to do. If you differ with me on this point then that’s because it is also easy not to. The early hours of a day can give you the energy to get more done without much stress. Time flies, and at 4am it surely does. Every moment you spend in not doing or following your life’s purpose is a moment spent in undoing it.

Most of the successful people I have met, track time consciously. And they don’t do it by the hour. They do it by the minute. Some of them, do it by the seconds. Once you get here, your amount of focus will determine if you will track time by the seconds. Peak performance is not an aim, it is a way of life. If you can get yourself to a happy, energetic mood before the hustle bustle of the world around your begins, then you have half won the day. Preparation is often the only differentiator between what gets done easy, and what gets done hardly. Consistency on the other hand will drive you into a spiral. Forward going, or backward moving spiral depends on the habits that you cultivate.

This cultivation is a daily activity, so here’s a thing to do. Wake up at 4am, and read. Read whatever you think will spur your interest, and read something positive. Let positivity spur your interest. This is the beginning of a spiral. Most of my guests spend their mornings in utter silence. They be in the moment, and they design the moment as a stepping stone for all the moments that follow in the day. Some people run at 5am. Running/ any kind of exercise as Casey Neistat often says, helps you cover for lesser sleep. It means that if you sleep for 6 hours a day, and run for 2 hours in the morning.

Your mind, and body will feel, and be healthier than sleeping for 8 hours, without any exercise. Usually, no mind bursts into unproductive habits the moment it wakes up. You need to give it direction. You can only make a few good decisions in a day. And the surety of a decision being good lies on how early in the day do you make a decision. Capitalize on the silence that you get in the morning. Not by making coffee though. Not by trudging through whatever direction your mind picks. But by being wakeful. By consciously knowing where you want to head, and what do you want to achieve.

This is what my guests spend an hour thinking in the morning. They don’t take down notes. They de-cide. Our brain is a database. It has stored memory, years of daily experiences which form the basis of your instinct. When you ask it a question, the first answer that you will get, is the right answer. The answer that your mind tells you, not the answer you speak out. Things will slowly accumulate to give you an edge, e.g. It took me some many bullet points to write a paragraph without having to strive for it. The most common mistake we do, is to not declutter. When you know how you spend your time, you have the power to question every action you take.

And by actions I mean things like looking left or glancing right. These small involuntary actions can shape a lot of your decisions. Because your senses will feed on the surplus of information that is now so easily available in this age. Your job is to consciously say “NO!”. It might take you days before you start catching yourself doing this. It might take you another few weeks to start saying “NO!” with ease. So a faster way of doing this is by beginning the day with self scrutiny. Analyzing your usual. An hour spent knowing where to catch yourself will help you catch yourself doing dumb shit better. You now have an exact summary of where your time goes.

If you relentlessly de-clutter, and spend your time doing only those things that you do in a day simultaneously, you will find yourself doing your usual at unusual hours. This bit itself is curiosity inspiring. Being curious is essential at being creative. And if you do your work beforehand, you will end up with mass, and I mean MASS amounts of time in the same day, without a clue of what more can you do. This is like writing down a bucket list with a 100 things on it. Most people have to really start thinking hard about their dreams once they fill in about 25–50 things. You will have to really put your mind to work in figuring out the not so dumb to do things for the rest of your day. That my friends, is a dilemma worth being in. If you are a creative, let me rephrase that: Life is a creative establishment. And creativity is the only positive way to live.

Nothing in life is easy. You can be anyone you want. You could be anyone now. But you will not be joyful if you don’t innovate your way through life. You should essentially think of the solutions to your most daunting problems/challenges at 6AM, or to be more exact, in the shower after your run. And read closely. Think of the solutions/challenges, not of your daunting problems. Make it a habit to take an hour long shower. This does not mean that you waste water by keeping your taps running. It solely means leaving your phone outside the bath, and spending an hour thinking in that closed room, undisturbed.

Silence, and solitude is an antidote to stress. See, the human mind zones out if it has to go through tremendous amount of mental stress, or physical pain. It zones out not as a cowardly response, but as a mere attempt to research for relief. It is searching for silence, and solitude so that it can be less distracted when it is working on finding the solutions to the objects of stress. Change of jobs is also a means of taking a break. I don’t mean your day-job. I mean doing something else at hand for sometime. It’s like you can either dribble yourself tired across the football pitch, and try to score a goal, or better, you can pass the ball from player to player, and be fresh enough to try scoring the goal again. You can choose to edit your bath short, and zone out while you make yourself some breakfast. But thinking while your eating can set in a habit of daydreaming.

Rejuvenating your body without paying close attention to the activity is not that healthy. Let’s stick to longer time in the showers for starters. Once you are ready to go-to work or wherever without a roof on yourself, try to find your horizon. Not mentally, but physically. Look at the further point of the street. I bet that you have not taken this gaze intently before. You will see things that you did not notice before. It can be a busy street, or it can be a plant on a field. But you will see new things. This is helpful because here’s what funny.

Your life is the exact replica of the things you notice, the things you do, and the behaviours you follow — your habits. One of my Hungarian friends has a knack for cleanliness, a kind of an OCD. He told me that it was an Hungarian thing. But I don’t think it’s something that is specific to a particular race of people. What he told me was this. There is a reason why human beings behave in a certain fashion to others based on a perceived effect of the person they are interacting with. We are all blinking (refer Malcolm Gladwell) at each other without a moment’s restraint. We are looking for the things we do. We are searching for clues. We are sizing people up.

Largely because “How you do anything is how you do everything.” This is the same reason why we humans have things like dinner dates, and luncheon meetings. It is a neat way of figuring someone out subconsciously by watching them eat. No wait, it’s watching them manage their plate rather. The way you organize yourself at the table can help people gauge your habits or reactions to life. The way you manage your food, or say resources. The way you treat table manners, or rules. What you do with the leftovers, if you have any. There are a lot of clues if you look closely. It is essentially the most believable metric to the effect of how our behaviors connect.

Our habits shape us. We really have a few habits. Only different scenarios, and variations of it. The most common habit that is widely evident in people is neglect. It is also one of the starting, and fueling habits of all the downward spirals in the history of mankind. Looking at the horizon physically, will help you look at your mental horizon. Your mind stretches in a direct proportion to the depth of your gaze. This is the effect of space on our minds. Space can affect our minds, emotions, thoughts, and hence hold an influence over the behaviors that we exhibit. After seeing people huddled together in a tiny space under the pretext of an event or a gathering, in spaces designed to accommodate such affairs, I have gathered an interest in better understanding people, and the effects that spaces /emotions play in their behaviors.

**An artist's abode by Rohit Mohite**.

It is rare to find a project where the clients have supreme clarity about what they want. This sort of clarity often rises from knowing what you don't want. The client is an artist. This provided us with a great opportunity to explore various ideas. She is clear that her desired language - which in this case - was Scandinavian style of home decor with a minimalistic approach to interiors.

She played a major role in this process. We gave her a house, and she made it a home. We thoroughly enjoyed working on this project.

**A perfect mess**.

You know what, I am happy that we are a perfect mess. And I think, the sooner we accept that, and not try to conform ourselves to any idea of perfection: we will be happy.

**Architects, and presentations**.

Coming to think of it, presentations scare me. Architecture has given me the skill set to sell ice to the Eskimos at prices even Jobs would fear to mark up. But that’s just talk. When it comes to doing work to present your projects, and if you are an architect who wants to develop a product for yourself. Please put a deadline before you put the price tag.

I find offhand inspiration at random moments during the year, when I can get more done in a week without having to push myself, while at other times, even an year long of work does not find the same level progress. The thing that I have caught myself doing is putting green tree marks on presentation sheets. Now I would certainly agree with you that you know ho to make those presentations look beautiful. Worth staring at! But have you ever found the amount of repetitive work that architects all over the world do creating the same styles of presentations. They rather be playing with an idea, then Photoshop their lives all along.

Because sometimes focus gets lost. You waver away from developing a product to making things beautiful. If you are not careful, then you may have to start another project to back the first. If you are yet less careful, then you may as well be stuck in a cycle — starting a project to back another one — that’s more like lying to save another lie. Instead, why don’t we worry about action and getting done with things, the simplest of the idea — the basis.

Why do most of us spend night after night plonking green trees on paper when we could be make ourselves more useful by doing. There is actually no need to plan a day — even today. Thinking keeps us thinking. Doing keeps us doing. Anything begets the same thing.

The energies you give into the universe come back to you — magnified. What I am getting at here is that, our focus should be only on the things that we know will make an actual difference as we progress towards our goals. Yes, goals, not dreams. Deciding — ‘decide’ means ‘to cut’ — is really a process of choosing what not to do. This is something I read in Essentialism by Greg McKeown.

I have seen noticeable difference in the amount of progress I have made with my life in the past two weeks since I began to decide. Decide is a verb. Beware! Architecture needs focus. Mostly on the things that matter. To achieve it, you may have to push your norms of acceptable behaviour that you follow in routine.

Every breath of it. Question everything… The time you wake up, the colour of the wall that you see, the time you take to get to the bath to wash your face, the number of apps you use, the number of times you check these apps between opening your eyes, and the visit to the bath for a face wash. Even the number of breaths you take, and so on… Question everything. It will help you look inwards, declutter your life fully, and do remember to do this every beating second of your life, find meaning about what you do/have to do — doing is not the end of things. But it is the reason most of us find the reason to live.

Remember this will make all the difference.

**Arguments**.

Let's talk about arguments. The whole concept of peace revolves around the presence mutual respect. I fear contempt more than the lack of mutual respect. I fight a lot everyday. Fight. Yes, fight. Not debate. Not argue. Not discuss. But yes, communicate. Having done so, I have found that most of us segue to other topics.

**A riding song**.

I was just riding alone;
On the way to my home.
I thought to take you along;
But you were gone.

Never did I realize;
You were riding for the sun.
If I never had cried;
In the library noon.

You would not have tried;
To keep me around.
Oh yes! I was then riding alone;
On the way to my home.

I thought to take you along;
But you were gone.
I suffered from yet another block;
Oh! This morning too soon.

Then I thought of your love;
And all it was gone.
My nose block, and fever;
Ain’t it nothing for you?

No no no, I was just riding alone;
On the way to my home.
I thought to take you along;
But you were gone.

**A rule for dating and life**.

She is the extreme good and the extreme bad. ek aur proof aaya mereko isse. proof for "the way you do anything is the way you do everything". bottomline, she is extreme. that closes her topic for now. but that lets you and I realize that the most quiet people are quiet constantly. the most extreme people are extreme constantly. iska matlab next ladka/ladki choose karna ho toh apne energy level ka hi choose karneka. nahi toh energy drain hoga kisi ek ka. yay! iska matlab if you want to be the chairman of your bank, you can choose to have the energy level of the chairman, and you will almost immediately be there. such classic physics!

**A rule of thumb**.

Not the exact nature of woodworking but the idea of how things can be built. Bit by bit, block by block, or layer by layer. This layering is what everything around us is made of. From emotions to nature, even time. Relativity, or a better word to use would be relational-ity, is the key of how human understanding is formed. The ability to understand phenomena by adding known context is essential. Although this approach can make it harder for us to accept some things because they don’t fit in our history of experiences. This bit can explain natural or supernatural occurrences. This bit can also explain why everyone ran 4-minute miles within a week of the first guy who ran it. The thing to take away here is that the most common mistake we do is to think that people think like we do.

Thought is an experiential concept. So is emotion. We are all living in a dream world. Our dependence on technology will devour all the humanness that is within us. Changing our sector of employment will be a need in the coming future. The only thing that is at the root of all our problems these days as a civilization is technology. The slot machine dopamine loops that we have shaped our lives around are something we will have to struggle to break out of eventually. Even though Amazon, and other multinational companies are making lives easier by providing for most of the services that were relevant in the past decade. This move is going to cost humanity. I believe Jeff Bezos may have good intentions but the overall effect of his actions are going to be the end all for most of us.

Netflix may provide you entertainment, and bring out the best of the entertainment world. But there is a catch. When I was a kid, I would literally have a season for theaters. I did not fancy them back then. Now I realize that the amount of social interaction that comes from being around real people, and interacting with other people on a daily basis does shape the overall personality that we hold. It shapes the risk we take, and also priorities our own comfort over what’s right. There is a storm coming. A storm of education debt that has accumulated in the United States Of America. It is something that we have not prepared for. If you have money to get through these tough times, you are safe.

If you have the ability to restrain yourself from spending your time, the most valuable resource, on dumb shit then you might not really need the amount of money the rich will spend in this time of crisis. I find it hard to accept the notion that most of us are oblivious to the obvious dangers of the current state of our civilization. I believe most of us are being lazy to chase less of social media, and more of life. There is so much more that we are missing out on by putting our heads down into our phones. There is so much more in libraries, theaters, and people that we haven’t tapped yet. Artificial intelligence may be claimed to be the best thing. But it comes with yet another catch. It comes with vast pockets of time that we haven’t thought of how to use. AI comes with idleness. And an idle mind is the devil’s workshop.

The vast source of information that is available to us is lethal.

- *An overdose of information is lethal.*

It will drive us into inactivity, indecisiveness, and sheer disconcert for the others around us. It brings lethargy. And this is the bubble that will burst with a lot of lives on stake. So what can be a the solution to this? Having a practical priority. Finding out what won’t change in the next decade for vocation. Gratitude towards everyone, and everything. Choosing others before you, collectively. Spending time together with people, not technology.

Our thumbs are probably a good indicator of where we are heading in our lives. Not the index finger that points out directions to others. Yes that’s correct. The index finger is for others. The thumb is for us. The things you hold, the things you make, and the things you tap on your screens have only one thing in common for all of us. The thumb. You may find the tone of this post hilarious, but then this is the only true indicator that’s right under our noses, that’s natural, from birth, and that’s devoid of any other need of technology. So if you are into profound thinking for making better decisions, asking better questions, and designing your own life then, start with your thumb. Your map will never be more accurate.

Delete the things you can’t contribute to, and delete the things that don’t contribute to you. It can be the things you hoard, your wardrobe, your friendships, and enmities. Your time is valuable. After the age of 18, with the ongoing rate of life expectancy in most countries, you will see only about 25000 sunrises. I hope this gives you a new perspective. Be present. Be present in the present. A friend told me that you cannot be in the future or the past. If you spend your mind being attached to the past, not only shall you miss out on what’s happening right now, but also be delusional. If only you can stay in the present, and let the universe explore itself through your creative senses.

It takes a certain amount of physical exercising like running to feel ready, and open minded to take in these expressions. Casey Neistat runs in NYC. Kushal Samant runs in Bangalore. No one stares at Casey, but they do at Kushal because Bangalore is more of a close knit community. This might explain why personal space is a thing for the Americans. This explains why Viren Brahmbhatt snapped, “What do you care?” when asked when his birthday was. It might come of as rude to some of us, but he was in the right. Behaviours are dominated by the place we belong to. Behaviours are not a cultural thing. Culture itself is a vague idea.

The people you keep are a bigger influence on your creativity than your past, and culture. The point to learn here is that we should focus on creating, and not creativity. Creativity comes. The way to do is to begin. You might never know what you will create.

But if you take the pen, and start scribbling, you will get past the first few lines of utter lack of clarity combined with wholesome words that have no direction to the conversations. But if you just begin, everything that’s messed up will start to fall into place. In ways that will make the mess seem like a petty folly.

**Ashore**.

Lines from a forgotten past
Time bound memories
Of sand on the grounds
Grass, and seaweed
For breakfast on board
While a burning sun, and mist
Color yellow anoraks ashore.

**A study in scarlet**.

Of expressing our emotions, and journaling innately inappropriate desires, in words and images, to know for myself, the exact nature of my being. So that I can edit myself, and make a version of me, through the process of constant trial and error, until I am certain about what I am.
