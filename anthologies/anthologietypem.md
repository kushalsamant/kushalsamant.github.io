**Anthologie - Type M**.

**Magic**.

Magic happens when you don’t give up, even though you want to. The universe always falls in love with a stubborn heart.

**Makerspace quotes**.

Experience,
Sprung from pain,
to change or gain,
with a will to see,
a new awakening.

Inspiration,
Inspired making,
to see a ray shining.

Ideation,
Lost in thoughts,
or thoughtful actions,
the ideas shall come in,
slow, and swarming.

Make,
To create a piece,
on your own,
learn by making,
and other such pangs.

Prototype,
Make a piece or pick any number,
make as many as you might;
‘coz the more you fail, the closer you get,
to the one you like.

Test,
Test your piece,
and behold the joy,
that only a maker can have,
amongst humanity.

**Make the most of this lockdown financially**.

So the whole ideas is to make a post on typewrighter using Google Voice input. Although this might sound like a  futile exercise, what I am trying to do is to write for 1 minute and this text becomes an article. Posting one article on typewriter gets me about 10 rupees a day. So if I have to earn about a lakh rupees in one day then I will have to post 10000 articles in total. The fun part is, since every article only takes a minute, I will have to spend 10000 minutes, or 167 hours, or roughly about 7 days, that is one week to reach my goal.

All of this need not have any predefined subject line, topic line, or sense. The entire success of this exercise, also contributes to being an essential tool for soundboarding. So much for global lockdown. I would suggest that you read this article once again, and clearly understand the steps within all of these sentences.

**Meetings**.

Why am I so lost? What drives meetings? To be honest, last week I was not fair enough to myself, my colleagues, and my work. I slept for 12 hours a day from my otherwise 2 hour routine. That was a lot of laid back time.

Thanks to my team, the work did not suffer. But there is something that was bothering me about my body forcing me to sleep it out rather than being all “Up!, Up!, Up!”, about life. Then about two days ago I drew up a plan to push myself out of the walls of my cave. The weather was not so great that afternoon you see. I went out to meet a wedding photographer to see the potential of selling her products on our charity store.

We did a half meeting something when you know you have to rush to meet someone else, and you agree to continue it on a later date. That same evening I lined myself up to a string of meetings. One with a random architect, one with my bestie, and one with someone I had never met before. As John Lennon quotes,

> “Life is what happens to you when you are busy making other plans”.

I did only one meeting of them all. The first one. On purpose. A deliberate choice. “Why?”, you may ask.

Well I met someone. I lost myself in a conversation that made me want more of it. That made me skip dinner, convince myself it was okay being rude to everyone who was lined up. But no worries, the line up was a smart one I am sure they saw that coming when I mentioned “random architect.” The thing here is I have slept a wink after 48 hours of being lost. That’s because I could think of nothing else to do but drool.

I am up now, still half asleep with pretty interesting work meetings for the evening. What I am trying to learn is that, what was it that the wedding photographer could not crack? What made her meeting — a half meeting? What made about the next meeting made me cancel the rest of my plans? What is it that keeps people glued?

I have never felt so “Up!, Up!, Up!”. Not even when my father showed me ways to travel all my life. It is a lot of energy waiting to be deployed. It is painful. It is distinct.

It is a constant will to do something about everything. I have been deploying plans like never before. Imagine, finishing things you procrastinated about for half an year in 48 hours. There is something that still remains a mystery to me. Something I think I should find out considering the worth it has for all the people who wants to make things work.

The worth of all the ideas that can crop up if only you had this particular feeling. Honestly, I have never found something linger so indefinitely on my ever so flaky mind. I have always had a set plan when going about things. At least there is a protocol. The urgency to follow it is situational.

We, lazy ass capricorns do that. Nothing new about that. I have spent hours talking about this. I can’t hide the fact even at my deliberate, non dramatic, quiet purposeful attempts. There was something new about that meeting.

Something that kept me glued. I have written emails about this, bothered a lot of people with late night phone calls about what makes a meeting interesting? Ah! this might be something Jon Westenberg could write about. Maybe he can answer this with all that wisdom he has gathered over the years. The mystery continues.

Was it the setting? Was it the topic? Was it the weather? Was it my determination to stay out? Was it me?

Maybe not. Maybe it’s all about the people.

**Memoir to the old man**.

So today I went to the post office to ship a parcel Internationale but the lady said come tomorrow for the tailor wasn’t around.

**Messy affair**.

Such a funny tale,
Epic fail,
Epic fail.
She could, when I couldn’t.

Then as fate would have it,
I could too,
I could too.
But her friends, stole her.

For the evening,
Leaving me,
Leaving me.
With a hope, restless.

**Migraine**.

She said she wanted to make love, but not while we worked hither, nor this or that, nor here or there. She had another hundred clauses to spare, I wish her life was simple still, for now she is stuck between blowing horns, not the pace she wished for today, for the traffic made her miss her gig. Now she has to apply again, though this is happening for the third time, yet she blames me for her migraine, I wish she wasn’t stuck in there.

**Mind**.

It is funny how our mind works. It is funny how we can tell a lot about people in the first instance. Our brains are databases, designed to give us a match from it’s storage for all our queries. That’s why most of the time we find that the design solution we began with is usually the best answer to any given problem. I read this in one of the books from the Bourne series.

I have found this to be true but then again, maybe what you believe in is what you will see. “How you do anything is how you do everything — even the way you wash utensils. Whether you choose to focus on cleaning the murk or do you focus on doing it till you run out of soap.” A Hungarian friend once told me that the way someone eats at the table is the way everything you need to know about someone. Maybe that’s why dates are dinner dates, and we close deals on lunch.

I thought of starting this article from here but then I drifted, and now I am being meta about it. How we write, tells so much more. Our mind is fascinating. It can see beyond itself, be the observer or the subject or both. This is what has always amazed me.

The way it searches for that one word which will fit in the context. The search for a word, that search for perfection, and the way it always attains it. This might be a hint so as to why perfection is not a myth. Maybe we have not learned to recognize it. The mind can see words sprawling, lying there in the vast emptiness of its own imagination.

Can you feel the ever tightening grip of that emptiness on your brain? Can you feel how when you rush the way you write, the nervousness of the brain to find the perfect word to feed the rush? Maybe we can say that the brain feeds to itself what we feed it. Sometimes even when we stop. Maybe this is true, “Which wolf will win?

He replied, “The one you feed.” It has been my experience about most of the thoughts I have had on certain days. Days when my belief in everything around me is so high, for I can step without looking back or flinching a tad bit onto a blazing freeway, and experience no harm come my way. The thoughts that run through my mind in these subtle moments, seems to manifest themselves in roughly about 7 years. Deja Vu, anyone?

**Modi & the English**.

I always thought that the English were smart people. But after last night's show of The King, I just realized that England is a tiny kingdom who lost a lot of kings and queens in battles trying to expand their kingdom across France. Most of these monarchs never ruled beyond 9 years. This also seems to be the process of trial and error through which the English were able to conceptualize the methods of colonization. The idea of occupying another country and capturing it under the premise of fair trade. So just as the Anglo-French Hundred Year's War was practice grounds for the English. In my understanding, the state of Gujarat has served as a practice ground for Narendra Modi. The traces of everything this tyrant Government of India does henceforth shall be evident in the recent history of Gujarat. Learning from the English history, the roots of this tyranny could lie as far ago as a 100 years. Maybe, more.

**Mohave**.

Out in the desert,
as a wind blows,
she saw in herself,
angst some more.

She could write stories,
some of her own,
of the past few weeks,
some months old.

A cold wind blew her dinner,
from those embers as they glow,
but she couldn’t care less,
she felt sore.

With all the tech around her,
to carry or hoard,
is it not a lot on your baggage,
to lose some, and snore.

Someday with unforgiving loneliness,
time will solve it all,
as you pass through Mohave,
through heat, and cold.

**Money**.

Money is strange.
The more I earn, the stranger it gets.

**Monogamy**.

Case 1: Monogamy is a pattern.

I am scared of people who say monogamy since July. Like they say they want monogamy, and want to make an effort to work things out. Then they call every five hours and talk for three hours everyday. They say they are okay with the grocery shopping, and cooking dinner together for the first date. They say that we should take care to not fuck on the first date, even if we are at home for dinner, and we cuddle later.

Then they will ask to fuck when we are cuddling, and that's okay. But here's the catch.
1-a. If I fuck them they will enjoy it, and ask for more sex in the same night.
1-b. But in the morning, they will say that they don't feel like working it out because they did not feel a connection *since the beginning*.

OR 

2-a. If I say that we agreed that we should take care to not fuck on the first date, then from that moment onwards they will literally push me away physically by placing their knee between us, and say that let's just go to sleep.
2-b. They will break all ties in the morning, and  they will say that they don't feel like working it out because they did not feel a connection *since the beginning*.

Conclusion: I am puzzled because if you did not feel anything since the beginning then why would you call me so much! 

Case 2: People flipping is a pattern.

This starts with Day 1, a woman telling me that she is as serious as 'she is looking to start a family'. Then she tells me on the weekend that she only want to fuck me. Then she shares explicit pictures a day later. Then she tells me a day later that she was only being horny from Day 1. Then she ghosts me a day later.

Then she disappears for 2 days. Then she returns to tell me a day later that she doesn't like me at all and we could be friends. Then she tells me a day later that she has enough friends, sure I have too, so we can only be acquaintances. Then she tells me a day later that she is unsure of when we will talk next because she talks to her friends once in a week.

Conclusion: I am puzzled about why would someone go from they want to start a family to ghosting me abruptly.

**Morning**.

It ain’t snow,
It’s raining;
I hope you,
Read this in the morning.
I say,
You have just 22 days to go;
So believe in carpe diem,
Carpe diem,
Carpe diem.

**Motherland**.

There is no sense in me, I wonder if you can feel, subtle substance in these, lyrics they call, in these songs that we cannot sing, if we could only hear the music, we wouldn’t need a guitar to please, our motherland. There are no trains to get home, there is just a long wait, for these men to work magic, and let us all reach the things we preach, day on, and day off, until the night screams for peace.

**Multiple sources**.

Do you know what the key to wealth is?

So the sooner you learn this the better it is. That's supposed to be the ending of the previous article. The sooner you learn that the better it is. if you look at what you can achieve using money or rather if you can figure out what you want to achieve using money that is where your calling lies. the trick is not to figure out how much money you want that request to figure out where you want to spend it.

have you ever observed that all the people in the world who keeps pending so much of the wealth in buying things in shopping in eating lot of good food and in travelling. These people they never seem to have a lack of money. They always seem to keep getting more. This seems like a law of nature to me. It is pretty interesting how things work no?

so again the trick to having lasting wealth is to spend it in the right places. Not saving, spending.

**Mumbai suburban railway**.

I don’t know about you, but often I need more enthusiasm to jot down few words here. Maybe, it’s the accessibility of the platform. Although, Medium has an app, it’s not their fault. The trouble lies with the facet that writing needs space. It needs comfortable keyboards, quiet spaces, or rather spaces that inspire thinking.

Having stated the obvious, I will continue completing this article on my train ride. I have noticed a peculiar detail that the Mumbai Suburban Rail Network adds to the lives of the general population. There is a thing about these trains that run around the city of Bombay. Most of these trains especially on the harbour line run late. Apart from the punctuality issue, there is a subconscious drive that is shaping the city.

The detail is an announcement. Whenever a train of 9 coaches pulls into a station that can occupy 12 coaches, they make an announcement. 

> “Yatriyon krupaya dhyan de. Platform no. xyz pe aane wali 12 debbo ki local, aaj 9 debbo ki aa rahi hai. Yatriyon Ko hone wali asuvidhase humein khhed hai.”

This translates to

> “Passengers please pay attention. The train arriving on platform no. xyz is of 9 coaches, instead of 12 coaches. The inconvenience caused to passengers is regretted.”

The peculiar bit is an apology. The reason these trains are shorter than the length of the platform is not clear to me. Since the trains can be accommodated in the platform. The announcement seem to be unnecessary. The apology drives into the subconscious, the idea that apologies are okay.

The emphasis on saying sorry, has been in my belief a cause for the attitude of the citizens to be complacent of the mistakes that they make. Millions of people wake up, and go through this idea driven into their subconscious day in, and day out. A stark observation made alongside these factors is that people have a complacent subconscious. Our first response to the errors we make is sorry. Since, this is a concept common to the masses, it has made complacency a normal.

The prevailing attitude is reflected in all the business transacted in this city, regardless of the nature of the situation. Is complacency the reason that a majority of the local population cultivates habits that lead to beliefs such as lack of punctuality is an obvious Indian flavour. This post was written to bring awareness about things that define the subconscious of the citizens every morning. It works with the idea that knowledge of a behaviour trait can help curb negativity. Since, the way you do anything is the way you do everything.

The long term impact of replacing old habits with a new set of habits will lead to a happier, mentally healthy, and productive society.

**Muse**.

Muse thou can be, but I need a lot of love making, to feel inspired, love making with travel indeed, so don’t you go there now, my heart shall burn if you don’t agree, agree to be a muse that does a lot of love making.
