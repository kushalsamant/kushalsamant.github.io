**Anthologie Type - C**.

**Cadbury**.

A smile turned into a frown as he expected some love to stay;  
for losing a like and a request on Instagram meant more to him than his girl making chocolate milkshake.

**Caffeine**.

When you have balls
That seem to erode nicotine
Pass through the smoke
Don’t settle for caffeine.

**Canciones de un incendio**.

Que todavía se hablan, si usted sabía que yo no podía oír de usted? Supongo que lo haría, y por lo tanto sería I. Sus huellas se borran, por el aullido de los vientos; Y, sin embargo, usted respira canciones de en el aire que nunca se me va a tragar, Y yo todavía grabar su nombre en las piedras que nunca de la banda de rodadura.

**Can you?**

Can you catch up tonight? or my imagination, is gonna burn my memory. Can we sit by the drive? or a soothing temptation, is gonna rape my melody. Can I see you in a different light? or my poetic expression, is gonna lose all theory. Can’t the world say goodbye? ‘coz in you my heart, has found my everything.

**Chance**.

From a tiresome decision to another chore take a chance someday. Follow your original detour this might backfire pretty much the same but you won’t have regrets on any other day.

**Circles**.

I think this is one of the rare posts agar aap not asked question before beginning to talk about it. I mean within this lockdown. Soyabean trying to not pick a topic and write a lot about it. The only trouble with this approach is that when I don't have a cold to talk about I end up wasting time trying to find a topic to write about or I end up looking at different ideas running parallel or intersecting each other or I just end up going around in circles. no matter how I look at this problem I will think I will need a group of people who will be able to suggest different topics that I can contribute to in the form of writing.

Or maybe I can build a pool of words that I can pick at random and write about. Honestly speaking I think it would be great to be able to get suggestions of topics. This is something like what the haikujam app does. But I agree that their idea is a slight variation of what an actual haiku is. But it's a good thing to learn from something that might not be creating the best of its own craft.

Learning again then becomes a byproduct of making mistakes by going around in circles.

**Clocks**.

When you are working from 8 PM to 4 AM every night, it is hard to realize how much of the news you are missing. I did not realize what the UK, and EU were upto until one of my colleagues popped the tripling of google searches on the topic, 17 hours after the vote was cast. Sometimes I feel that was a stupid thing to do. But maybe they were all being smart by checking for changes on the www. The point is I don’t think keeping the know how of the news is important enough.

If it matters to you, your friends, and family will tell you about it. People in most of the places I have been to work complained about the amount of attention my work received. I should focus more on resting they said. But have you ever given it a thought? If you are going to an office, you are going there to create something, maybe destroy something — once I worked at a cafe where they taught me how to peel of oranges beautifully, they said.

How sad! I love oranges. That was pure destruction. I quit in a week — but you go there to get something done. Isn’t it obvious that you don’t stop until it gets done? Where did these ideas of rest for the sake of closing time come from? Blame the Industrial revolution for it.

Most of us wait on the clock for that bell. I believe that by noon, most of us forget that they woke up this morning for bringing in the light. Most of us forget that they got out of that bed for a reason. But the few who remember don’t get to the sack until they are done. How much do you work?

How many hours of a week do you put in? These questions hardly make any sense when to a few of us. The ones I met did not wear watches. They would ignore the artificial sense of time, and go from one task to another. They would rest when they were waiting for updates.

Things like someone on the team sleeping the night away would annoy them. Sometimes I think this is idiotic. But then if you look at the progress they made towards things like financial freedom was phenomenal. These people did not work with the world’s dogma of a clock. They ran a measure of time beyond the cycle of days, and nights, but one that was defined by project deadlines.

Projects that were defined not by the money they made, but by progress. Progress towards living life without having to work for the rest of it. Astonishingly, most of these people are kids. 21 or so in age. And they are travelling, the world, unbound.

**Closer**.

She heard a teardrop for she could now see all the vile things that drew her closer to him, and his voice seemed cropped, crippled by her teardrops.

**C’mon**.

Step up to the unknown, it’s beautiful inside
With beach sand flowing, into the high tide,
These moments disappear, with a frightful force,
Every cop patrolling, these sands last night,
Little to be lost, staring at the horizon behind,
Within a cloud of seamist, lies the unknown,
Beckoning my soul, to the depths of an ocean,
Cries of seagulls, and a big shoal.

C’mon, C’mon, C’mon.

**Coffee**.

Is it time for some coffee already?

It might be sort of very annoying for a lot of us to figure out how do we tackle this ongoing economic crisis that the entire planet probably is facing. Now I don't have an answer for that but I can share something from my past experience which might make some sense to solving your own personal economic crisis. The mistake that I have often done is to stop myself from contributing to the one single task that gives me any kind of returns. Has social beings, we measure returns by their size, or scale, or something else that affects the amount of respect our peers grant us. This outlook is a mistake.

A better thing to do would be to find something that is non zero. Find anything that is giving you a return that is not zero. And then triple down your effort on that one single thing. Your efforts will keep generating returns that keep compounding if you are consistent. This consistent effort that generates a non-zero return is the answer to solve your own personal economic crisis.

**Collective**.

Some things in life need a lot more rhythm to it than you can beat. And that’s okay. So today I went to a movie screening. There were thoughts being shared about collective work in the city. About how the people collectively make a city without any formal inspiration. Now I have a question. If the boundaries are to be dissolved, and the city becomes an ocean of collaboration, where, and how does one creative mind find individuality OR Identity of a creative expression? Does anybody have any thoughts?

**Competition 10000**.

I want to taken hear you but I think the emails to write about a 10000 articles on typewriter and that's all. Mishal Thomas 2018 new achieve something as naturopathy feel it from you very very standpoint you thank you know that the whole. Of it American want to build something take out of nothing comes by twins why do they say goodbye. For that's great things come when small great things happen with small things come together something about nature is interesting but do you know there was a friend of mine who have this from your friend when he was in his master's course from there in the lage in architecture in the blanks and this is goal is to comment proposed on the sketch on the wall everyday and she do this on on on on on on for many days and soon atikraman stand seat cover the entire wallet always sketches the whole idea that we can actually learn from this example on this incident was that she started of the one small thing in which collector of it and that you need all the reference competition I am putting out right now on typewriter for everybody out here is to have as many post has taken the logic is this view of the current situation and nobody has means to on anything if you are corporate job is great for you but you cannot make operator job in a physical state forward to come to normal and 117 normalises additional see you will be able to then you know that are something else office so so what I am currently right now is to see that I want to to see for example forget about to write five articles and makeup 200% and 200 courses pay me about 10 rupees a day I want to make 10 lakh from different to make like to 10000 rupees 80 have to do ten thousand times no right then 10,000 10,000 10,000 so I have to write about thousand times more and I'm not saying everyday just one time thing you write an articles explicitly means how much tall man in the political. Limit on the textbox I think you is it now this no limit so you get me 5 articles get you 10 rupees then get 10,000 10,000 rupees you need to write how many articles to write 10,000 by 5 is equal to mm 10000 by 10,000 into 500 5,000 articles then you get about 10000 rupees a day bad number to have as passive income ideas with that number is not reach 2018 the charcoal 5000 if you understand what I am doing I so I am using Google voice input right now that's why everything is good but if you understand then find you I am trying to increase the space of national 28 articles in stock broking and furious by using voice to text instead of typing my let me letters out this is me be faster than you and that see who gets there was no matter who gets the first just being a part of this process is going to be this platform and where all can get paid and get money to make sure country's economy its fact no thank you so much for opportunity of people in this app wish something happens of this all the best wishes to all of you.

**Consistency**.

**Consistency I**.

Do you know how powerful consistency is?

Like I said in the previously, compounding is a hedge against failing at consistency. This is because aa... let me tell you a story.

There was an article on medium.com a few years ago. This article was by this guy called James Clear. well I read it at first and then I could never find it again I bookmarked it but it was taken down for some obscure reason which is still not clear to me yet. so let me just tell you just talk something I have learnt from it and let me add some of my own thoughts to it.

The whole idea behind James article was finding the what the why and how of how we succeed in life and can keep at it. One of my teachers from school used to tell me that getting to the first rank is easy. The difficult part is staying first throughout your schooling life. And I think James's article answered how to do that.

So there is a rule that I am assuming you must be very well aware of. It is called the Pareto principle. in simple terms it mean stack 20% of the effort that you put will give you 80% of the results that you get. Now Pareto who was in Italian economist who had a pea garden.

In his story, Pareto discovered his rule by observing that 20% of the pea pods where producing 80% of his peas. And then he observed this ratio in almost everything in life and which is how he came to to publish the Pareto principle. 

What James did is exactly the same thing. James Clear planted a pee garden. But in an attempt to document and verify or understand the Pareto principle, James also installed cameras to take pictures of his pee garden. and James did not take the pictures from the top instead he took them from the side.

As a result what James observed was that the speed of the pea pods that give him most of his peas wood grow sharply when they were closer to the height of all the plants around them. And they would continue to grow slowly when they weren't close to the height of any of the other pea pods around them.

Now a plant needs three things to grow that James could not control. Light, good soil, and air. James could water all of them equally, but he could not control how much light a particular pod would get. He could not control how much of the nutrients that particular pod would absorb from the soil, and he could not control how much of the oxygen in the air around them would a pod take.

But in his observation, James showcased with photographic proof that the parts that give him most of his produce would grow at a sharply fast speed when they were closer to the height of all the plants around them.

I am continuing this in the next chapter.

**Consistency II.**

Do you know how powerful consistency is?

Continuing from the previous chapter, what James inferred was that in the human perspective this is how things would play.

Now imagine an Olympic race or rather an Olympic swimming contest. This is what James called "The Winner Takes It All" syndrome. In an Olympic contest the difference between a winner and the person who comes as a runner up, can be defined by a split microsecond. But the reward that someone who comes second gets is nothing. Zero. Zilch... compared to the report that the winner gets. The winner will get better coaching better sponsorships better events better leagues the gold ofcourse and other things that come with winning. Which means that now the winner is in a position to compete better. 

You have to remember that the winner is being able to get all the goodstuff due to a slight difference in performance. Which means that the winner has to be slightly better in every race when compared to all his competitors to keep up on this winning spiral.

Now in a very common real world scenario that is you and me. For us, it means that next time you go to a job interview, you don't have to be the best in class or the gold medalist at the university or the best in your field to crack the job interview. All you have to do, is to be slightly again slightly better than the other applicants.

Remember "slightly".

I will continue this in the next chapter.

**Consistency III**.

Do you know how powerful consistency is?

Continuing from the previous chapter. Remember "slightly"? That is the key to understand how the Pareto principle works.

Now in my understanding the thing that you will learn in this chapter is one of the best takeaways from James Clear's work. It is the "Why?" of the Pareto principle.

Why does the Pareto principle work?

This is sort of a long story, but the answer lies here. Here's how. There was a guy called Denis Diderot. His greatest contribution towards is that he is the sole author of the original encyclopaedia. He was a French Man and he led a very poor life. Until the queen of France appointed him as the chief librarian of France. She also gave him a monthly stipend for his simple lifestyle. All was well until one day some aristocrat gave Denis a purple robe.

The purple robe. It is very popular as a story. Diderot fell in love with his robe. One day, a famous French painter made a painting of Denis Diderot and his purple robe. As a result, Diderot noticed how all his other belongings would appear dull, grim, and poor in comparison to his royal robe. 

So he started spending his money on buying things that would go well with the robe. Soon enough he ran out of money. On knowing that her chief librarian has gone broke, the queen of France did it again. She gave him a lot of wealth again.

Diderot started spending his wealth again. To cut the long story short, soon enough, Denis Diderot's robe appeared dull, grim and poor in comparison to his other belongings. Diderot went broke for the second time.

This is popularly known as the Diderot effect.

Remember "the Diderot effect". I will continue in the next chapter.

**Consistency IV**.

Do you know how powerful consistency is?

Remember "the Diderot effect"? Continuing from the previous chapter. This is what the takeaway from it is.

Why does the Diderot effect work?

When you give something you are also setting yourself up to give a bit more of yourself. For example, when you buy running shoes because you want to go running every morning, from reasons varying from, " looks cool" to "you want to say healthy": you are also setting yourself up to spend on the socks, your shorts, your running Jersey, and maybe an iPod because duh music!

This is what happened with Denis Diderot.

What you see is the backward spiral of "The Winner Takes It All" effect/syndrome. It also happens with slight changes but in the wrong direction. Remember slightly" from the first chapter about consistency?

Itis important to know that when you enter any spiral good or bad, your journey on it will often continue due to slight changes that you make. This will continue to the point when you are at your worst. Yes, the good news is that even the backward spiral has a limit.

When anything you do will be better than everything you have done so far. This means that whatever you do next will mark a shift in progress in the forward direction.

The takeaway (from chapters 1, 2, and 3 of this article) is that the defining quality which keeps a spiral going forward to backward to again forward, is the consistency with which you make slight progress in any direction.

Consistency can solely chart your journey through life at a positive beginning or a negative ending or at a negative beginning and positive ending or any end result that you would like to reach.

If you understand this then all you know that you have to keep creating and making an effort. Good or bad doesn't matter. After all everything is like a sine wave. The general law of nature is that whatever goes up has to come down, and whatever goes down will come up.

**Content creation for architects**.

I think you are thinking old school where the only way information would flow would be through peer recommendation. This is the internet age. You are as good as your content. Regardless of who thinks what. As long as the content you put out is universally true, you are good enough.

A[1. Make a post,
2. Repeat 1,
3. Repeat 2,
4. Repeat 3, and so on], B[...], C[...], and so on beyond Z[...], AA[...], AB[...], AC[...], and so on.

If you then pick the best of your thoughts between A[...], B[...], C[...], and so on... to compile books A[...], B[...], C[...], and so on... you will have enough for the credibility you are looking for.

**Continuity**.

To help us go down memory lane, to crave a feeling of nostalgia. Even if as we speak of many memories that buildings evoke. There is nothing more than reflection to be found in those moments. It may be hard to accept as certain spaces evolve, but after all time changes, and things change with it. There are many places that most of us would go back to.

To be in a time space of yesteryears, and to revolve a day or two in continuing those memories. But the fun lies not in reflection, but rather those hard, and fast stories that reality brings down on us. It watching things evolve just as a plant might take root upon the earth. There are so many such stages, that we forget about some until some happenings remind us about those in an instant. Every stage has a reason and those are the links that lead to learning in everything.

Do you know what the world needs?
A phone without the camera.

Can you lick your elbow?
You have tried that before.

How many Ferrari’s can you buy?
One. They are meant to be gifts.

Is there a toilet in the basement?
Ask Pee Provider.

Is coldplay coming to Mumbai?
We still don’t know who won those tickets.

Why do night watchmen sleep?
Because alcohol is so cheap.

Why do you need a maid?
Maybe you think you are Queen Elizabeth.

Why not disconnect?
Because the old dial-up still sings in your head.

Why don’t you make your own things?
Because you value your own time. Not human race’s.

Why do transformers have stones under them?
For massive earthing.

Coming to the point, we have all been working. On small things that require little attention. We have been on spending our time, on social media. Most of us, unaware of who our neighbours are. This has all been done and dusted.

You have known about this idea for years now, if not decades.
What happens when we ignore the things we know?
Climate change.

Cedric Price might be wrong when he said, “Technology is the answer.” We, humans are guilty. Of spending time doing things that don’t matter. — Technology, social media, checking your phone, ordering food online instead of walking to a cafe where you can meet people so that people don’t crash, carrying anything but your keys, wearing a full sleeve shirt, killing mosquitoes with chemicals, watching videos instead of books, looking down at your phone, eating meals without conversations, drinking water between the meals, blah blah blah. How do you decide if something matters? Try not doing it.

Instead. If we choose to weed out everything we have learnt, own or meet. We will not have decluttered, but discovered ourselves. And experience the world in a new light.

Do you know what the world needs the most?
Questions. A lot of them.

**Countryside**.

I should have been at 5,000 post but I am still at about 170, and I am not blaming anything for it it is just that I am lazy. Interestingly I have been able to improve my speech lot, have a couple of phone fights here and there, and arguments on the phone, but that's it. I often keep thinking that I should go back to the small place where I did my schooling and start accepting residentships for my Airbnb guests. It would be cool, no? To go in the countryside and live with people who come to stay with you to learn something from you and then you learn something from them in exchange. I think that must be really great idea because then you can also enjoy the countryside, have your bills paid, grow your network, and at the same time be great at your craft.

**Courage**.

How strange is it?
We tell all our feelings
To those who ask us out
But never to the love we seek.

**Covid19 pandemic**.

"I think NatGeo cooked SARS-Cov-2 /myth (because #Covid19 only to those who are already ill w: cancer, diabetes, due for surgery), so with media spreading fear, you agree to spend more time at home. *It's good for nature*, PLUS More WFH lifestyle means you use more AT&T WiFi (1. owned by NatGeo) to watch Netflix (1.), PLUS you pay more to a private electricity company (hospitals and #Covid19 pay pharmaceutical industry, you don't) - is how World Bank (because WHO labels #Covid19 a pandemic) funds to governments/corporations, shows up as salary hikes, and gets converted to white money."

What do you think?

**Crashing**.

Somethings are worth fighting for, somethings are not, for some people choose the easy way, and in their horrors they drown you away. Some people write it on paper, burn away the rest of their souls, for love is not found in these things people say, in the things they tell you to make you like them, love is found in staying, staying even when the times seem tough, waiting for the hard times to pass, and begin again, not everyone will understand this for they are afraid, afraid that they might be wrong, about happiness or pain. For fear ruled their minds when they wrote about love, you see love is the opposite of fear instead, that’s why I don’t believe in these posts that don’t ring true to my heart, for my heart was not stolen, I gave it to you, to crush, and play all day, until you want to crash into me, and keep crashing again.

**Crowd management in exigencies**.

They have been extending the lockdown by 2 weeks whenever the scheduled end is around the corner. India started a lockdown on the 22nd of March. So far, the lockdown has been scheduled to end on 14th April, 30th April, 4th May, (and 17th May for some states). Some municipality worker has been heard of quoting June 10th to be the final date. June 10th is 3 months from March 10th - the festival of lights, Holi - which is when presumably, everyone was out celebrating socially, aka not social distancing.

So, my common sense dictates that all governments of highly populated nations will enforce 3 months of lockdown/quarantine in total. Here's the fun bit about 'quarantine' from Wikipedia: The word 'quarantine' comes from quarantena, meaning "forty days", used in the Venetian language in the 14th and 15th centuries. The word is designated in the period during which all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the Black Death plague. The quarantena followed the trentino, or "thirty-day isolation" period, first imposed in 1347 in the Republic of Ragusa, Dalmatia (modern Dubrovnik in Croatia). Merriam-Webster gives various meanings to the noun form, including "a period of 40 days", several relating to ships, "a state of enforced isolation", and as "a restriction on the movement of people and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of disease or pests".

The word is also used as a verb. Quarantine is distinct from medical isolation, in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population. Quarantine may be used interchangeably with cordon sanitaire, and although the terms are related, cordon sanitaire refers to the restriction of movement of people into or out of a defined geographic area, such as a community, in order to prevent an infection from spreading.

**Crowds**.

Why do the crowds cheer aloud?

If you have ever been to Times Square or Marine Drive, you will find people staring into space, groups minding their own business. No one ever bothers you with, “Hey man! What are you doing?” People seem to understand. But they are all quiet. But have you noticed that when large crowds assemble at a concert, they are screaming even if it is senseless with the mic off. It is all for one purpose — to russell.

**Curb**.

Wishful thinking
Red lights blinking
Inching slowly for the curb
Better walk than run over.

**Curing a hickey**.

1. Water in a steel glass.
2. Frozen for 12 hours.
3. Pressed this steel glass on the hickey for 30 mins, with gentle massaging at intervals.
4. After 60 mins, stretched the skin, and rubbed this steel glass over the hickey for 30 mins, with gentle massaging at intervals.
5. Slept in a warm coziest blanket I could find, and hoped that my logic about capillaries, skin, and temperature would work.
