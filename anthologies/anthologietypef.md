**Anthologie - Type F**.

**Facebook**.

> “Everything around me is evaporating. My whole life, my memories, my imagination, and its contents, my personality?-?it’s all evaporating. I continuously feel that I was someone else, that I felt something else, that I thought something else. What I’m attending here is a show with another set. And the show I’m attending is myself.”  
> Fernando Pessoa, The Book of Disquiet.

Why should I do something about Facebook?

Here’s what I know.

Mark Zuckerberg, aims to connect the world. Well that’s such a noble thought. I couldn’t agree more. But then simply put, Mark is making money off me. With or without my knowledge can be a perfect place to start a debate in his favour, but. Do I need a friend who is as noble as a doctor, offers me chocolates, and then bills me for diabetic treatment?

This is what I think.

I believe that the way you do anything, is the way you do everything. This means that your failures/ successes will be same in every aspect of your life. This means that the amount of focus you put in brushing your teeth (usually the first task of the day for most people), is the amount of focus you will put in the rest of it. The amount of focus that you apply to your principles, are reflected in your habits. Your habits shape your weeks, day by day. All of these cycles of successes, or failures, start at every other action you make in your waking hours. I have a feeling your dreams count too. That’s why I dreamt of punching orders, and have certain nightmares which are directly synonymous with the happenings of a whole week. I believe that if self respect is a concern for you, then it should be a concern to the T. Read that as, “If anything is a concern for you, then it should be a concern to the T.”

Else I consider the lesser level of concern as hypocritical. I believe that any level of half heartedness is reflected back in every thing you do. So my question to you is, do you want a half hearted life? half hearted success? Oh! Thank goodness, that means your failures won’t hit you hard, because they are half hearted too. But then again, do you want failures? Coming back to “Do I need a friend who is as noble as a doctor, offers me chocolates, and then bills me for diabetic treatment?”

“No.”

Because of the vibe that kind of duality brings into my life. This is why I quit Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp. To be honest, it is a matter of a question, more than anything else. To be honest, it is a matter of a revelation, more than anything else. To be honest, it is a matter of humanity’s future, more than anything else. Humanity’s future because posterity will carry the vibe, and that’s making everyone of us, “A friend who is as noble as a doctor, offering others chocolates, and then billing them for diabetic treatment.” That future, is something I don’t want, because I think, it is hypocritical to the T.

> “So many people live within unhappy circumstances, and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man’s living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new, and different sun.”

**Fill**.

And fill the air with rustic pride
Till we find another sunrise
For the silences in the night
Don’t let me fall in your dreams for life.

Fill.

And fill the air with rustic pride 
Till we find another sunrise 
For the silences in the night 
Don’t let me fall into your dreams for life.

**Firefly**.

This might be late but realize
It is too hard to write,
When you are happy,
Coz’ there are so many thoughts to catch,
Like butterflies in the night skies,
Or was it a firefly!
I wonder why was every night
Memorable
That I spent
In the company
Of fireflies.

**Free**.

Of living with her. And spending every moment in her presence, shut the world out, and create things of immense cuteness (not babies, if you are there yet), I want to make passionate love to her, and get dirty in every passing moment, take her out to places, where we can hear the universe inside of us, travel with her crazy, adopt a dog before getting a child, sauna every morning, and together we mould a work free life.

**Fuck**.

Fuck me while you can, fuck me while no one has their eyes on us, spoon with me till we have some life. Showers of youth in our soul, like a whispering gasp for a boner, and the sweet silence on a phone call, from decent talks to dirty sex, let us bare ourselves to one another, find a spark of love in our lust, and a climax with all the regret, and guilt of not having met, you before.
