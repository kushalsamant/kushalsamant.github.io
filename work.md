**Quotes**.

> "...And last but not least, good design is as little design as possible."  
> Dieter Rams.

> "...that thing you see at the top of the terrace is called a parapet."  
> Mitalee Samant.

> "A good architect works slowly."  
> Alvaro Siza Vieira.

> "A typical dinner from the ape menu would be tofu bake with ratatouille of aubergine, onions and sweet peppers, with pearled barley and vegetable side dishes, says the team."  
> New Scientist.

> "A way to grow is: to consciously do things, that are not your normal, for the sole purpose of experiencing what happens next, so you know new phenomena, which makes you and your life - phenomenal."  
> Kushal Samant.

> "Action expresses priorities."  
> Mahatma Gandhi.

> Raymond 'Red' Reddington : "Are you a gambling man, Crispin?"  
> Sir Crispin Crandall : "No. I abhor casinos."  
> Raymond 'Red' Reddington : "Oh, yes. Well, I would agree with you there. But perhaps you're familiar with the old saw "You can't beat the house"? No matter how many poor souls you turn into popsicles, the fix is in. The world in which you awaken will be one incapable of sustaining human life. And why? Because at the critical tipping point, one tragically quixotic megalomaniac cannibalized humanity of the very minds that might have been its salvation. You see, if you were a betting man, you would understand that now trumps later every time. The future is a sucker's bet, a maybe, a contingency, a "What if?" The only thing that is real is the present, and you've plundered it, robbed it of the very geniuses that might have averted the dystopia you so fear. Indeed, perhaps even the very one who might have devised a means to revive your sad, tired, frozen ass. Congratulations, Crispin. You've doubled down on extinction. Life on Earth is going to end. Soon."  
> The Blacklist, a series on Netflix.

> "As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters."

> "Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do. The best way to predict the future is to invent it."  
> Alan Kay.

> "For some reason, I've turned myself inside out and all my guts have spilled onto my blog."  
> James Altucher.

> "Genuine love is volitional rather than emotional. The person who truely loves does so because of a decision to love. This person has made a commitment to be loving whether or not the loving feeling is present ...Conversely, it is not only possible but necessary for a loving person to avoid acting on feelings of love."  
> M. Scott Peck, The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values, and Spiritual Growth.

> "I feel sympathy for the working class lad. I've always championed about ticket prices and try to equate that to people's salaries."

> Toyota Formula One Team.

> "The goal is to make a space where a few ideas and images and feelings may be so arranged that a reader will want to linger awhile among them, rather than to flee."  
> Janet Malcolm.

> "The only way you survive on all these services is if you're groundbreaking. There's pressure to be groundbreaking, which is the greatest thing that's ever happened. It's a bizarre aspect of what's happened with all of these subscription services is everyone is trying to outdo each other by doing great things."
