**A dating pattern**.  
Oh well, I have been on dating apps since 2014. So I have an idea about that.  
1. Dating app algorithms give you a match mostly on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  
Not on Mondays.  
1.  A.  
Most people talk, get close, hookup or get intimate by Sunday.  
1.  B.  
Then the work week begins and you know that your partner lacks somethings.  
Everyone does.  
I do too.  
1.  C.  
You get new matches on the Wednesday/ Thursday again.  
1.  D.  
Here's the catch.  
If you talk to anyone new, then you are splitting your attention between two people.  
Your partner will notice this.  
Your partner will do the same.  
1.  E.  
By the time it's Monday, your partner is already with the new person.  
1.  F.  
You get dumped because you are not-perfect no.  
1.  G.  
You sulk until Wednesday/ Thursday, and viola.  
You have a new match!
P.S.: This is a time mapped problem.  
If you cut your nails at 1.  a.  , then by the time you have completed the story and reached 1.  g.  
You will have to cut your nails again.  
:D
