**Investment plan**.  

The following is a method to manage your money better.  

1.   Get 8 Bank Accounts.  

2.   Use these Bank Accounts in the following ways strictly.  

3.   Do not waver.  

Use Bank Account #1 as 100% of your Collections account for all incoming funds.  

From Bank Account #1,  
Transfer an amount equal to 50% of your collections (or as advised by your tax accountant) to Bank Account #2 i.e. your Tax account for paying tax.  

Transfer an amount equal to 50% of your collections to Bank Account #3 i.e. your Main account for business and living expenses.  

In Bank Account #3,  
Reserve an amount equal to 20% of your collections for business and living expenses.  
Reserve an amount equal to 5% of your collections for all business marketing purposes.  
This business marketing reserve should earn the expected gross revenue i.e. 100% of your Bank Account #1.  

From Bank Account #3,  
Transfer an amount equal to 5% of your collections to Bank Account #4 i.e. your Investment account for debt, gold, investments, mutual funds, and share/stock trading.  

Transfer an amount equal to 5% of your collections to Bank Account #5 i.e. Cash Account for buying real estate.  
You should buy real estate in cash only.  

Transfer an amount equal to 5% of your collections to Bank Account #6 i.e. Cash Account for the education of any progeny.  

Transfer an amount equal to 5% of your collections to Bank Account #7 i.e. Cash Account for health purposes.  

Transfer an amount equal to 5% of your collections to Bank Account #8 i.e. Cash Account for parents or parental care.
