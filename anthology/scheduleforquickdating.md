**Schedule for quick dating**  
Here's a schedule for quick dating that I religiously followed from 2014 to 2016 to be able to blink about people.  
It helped me meet a variety of people from various walks of life using applications like Airbnb, Aisle, Bumble, Hinge, Facebook, Haikujam, Instagram, Tinder, and Twitter.  
It was a great learning experience for me.
