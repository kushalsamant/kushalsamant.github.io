**Consistency III**.  
Continuing from the previous chapter.  
Remember "slightly"? That is the key to understand how the Pareto principle works.  
Now in my understanding the thing that you will learn in this chapter is one of the best takeaways from James Clear's work.  
It is the "Why?" of the Pareto principle.  
Why does the Pareto principle work?
This is sort of a long story, but the answer lies here.  
Here's how.  
There was a guy called Denis Diderot.  
His greatest contribution towards is that he is the sole author of the original encyclopaedia.  
He was a French Man and he led a very poor life.  
Until the queen of France appointed him as the chief librarian of France.  
She also gave him a monthly stipend for his simple lifestyle.  
All was well until one day some aristocrat gave Denis a purple robe.  
The purple robe.  
It is very popular as a story.  
Diderot fell in love with his robe.  
One day, a famous French painter made a painting of Denis Diderot and his purple robe.  
As a result, Diderot noticed how all his other belongings would appear dull, grim, and poor in comparison to his royal robe.  

So he started spending his money on buying things that would go well with the robe.  
Soon enough he ran out of money.  
On knowing that her chief librarian has gone broke, the queen of France did it again.  
She gave him a lot of wealth again.  
Diderot started spending his wealth again.  
To cut the long story short, soon enough, Denis Diderot's robe appeared dull, grim and poor in comparison to his other belongings.  
Diderot went broke for the second time.  
This is popularly known as the Diderot effect.  
Remember "the Diderot effect".  
I will continue in the next chapter.
