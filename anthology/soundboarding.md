**Soundboarding**  
Soundboarding is basically process in which a person say for example me.  
I will talk to you about my problem/s or probably about things I am dealing with in my problem/s.  
I will tell you the story of my life or of my project/s.  
In process tell you the story of my project, I will figure out all the blocks that I am currently trying to solve in that project.  
Now soundboarding does not necessarily involve a lot of involvement from your end.  
Except that you will have to probably listen to everything that I am saying without interrupting me or maybe with a bit of curiosity and exercising some amount of restraint.  
What I mean to say is that you will pull me back if I am digressing a lot.  
So that is where your support ends.  
If you are an expert of the topic that I am discussing then you will share your inputs, not necessarily a lecture, but small tweak in my flow of thought, and all of these inputs will add clarity to my flow of thought.  
It is what will generate the answers to the problems that I am facing currently.  
I deal with questions that people need help with.  
I can create a step by step path for someone to get from point A to point B.  

How do we do it?
1. You talk,
2. give me a complete idea of what you are doing,
3. then you tell me your problems,
4. then we will talk about what you have tried so far,
5. then we play tetris with all variables,
6. then we will know what works best in the current scenario
