**Lancymark**.  
Thoughtful this be unlike random bickering, 
I wish some more joy for you as a cure for it all, 
with a passing train on a railroad cross.  

Across a bridge lies my heart tonight, 
this I know now since you wrote these lines, 
I hope we all be found; found in the best of moods for life.
