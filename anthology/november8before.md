**“Before.”**

**Tuesday, November 8, U.S Presidential Election 2016**.  
Creativity is to be played on a mind map, not a time map.  
Deliberation is not the means to achieve most of what life offers.  
I want to publish everything I have that helps others be better at what they do.  
Thinking of it I might be reliving the same mistake of trying to get people to get better to help them help themselves gets me nowhere.  
I should leave that to Anthony Robbins.  
I remember when I was learning to ride.  
I was kickstarting the Vespa, and then I found myself doing the whole exercise for what felt like 5 full mins.  
My dad said this —

“Just do it, you are thinking too much.”  

It did not take half a kick to start that scooter after listening to that.  
I need to empty my mind.  
Most of this list making, and following up we do is the best example of how humans have continued to live in the past.  
There is some addiction to linger ourselves in that space, and analytics Why don’t we ban the word from our vocabulary? There is no apparent reason to make a list, take a picture, for creating more physical waste to harness our nostalgia.  
I can take this idea to the extent that if fully applied, the planet will need no more saving.  
Live in the present.  
Use bookmarks.  
So that when you return to things this means everything from actual bookmarks to the ones on your browser you will rediscover from your past.  
I swear don’t you go on adding my Medium posts on your Keep for reading later.  
Bookmark, don’t collect.  
Humans have been hoarding things since times immemorial.  
This is you.  
This is your free planet.  
Now imagine this on a globe.  
If there is something you really need, you know where to find it.  
You need to live light.  
Not just travel light.  
Some pun clarity.  

There is no point taking coconuts to Jaipur from Kerala because you think you may not find them there.  
You just need to look for it.  
I am sure Malayalees are everywhere.  

Malayalees are humans.  
So humans are everywhere.  
You will find things for your survival wherever you go.  
Unless you are Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton.  
You might complain about the time, and money you have to spend on travel if you don’t carry your turtle pack.  
But trust me, you use the things from your dearest turtle pack because you have those things around.  

Let me ask you a question.  
How many times have you borrowed a laptop or an iPod or an iPad or anything else that you might carry in your turtle pack from some random stranger on the street? Have you ever? Hmm… Really? So now you know, you can leave the house with just the keys, if you need to get back in.  
Most of the times, there will be someone to open the door, right? or if you are living alone you can hide it under the pots.  
Although I will not recommend pot.  

If you think I am crazy, and everything else is so much important, everything else on your list is either a distraction, an addiction, or term it whatever you may everything else is a space changer excuses for our mind to distract ourselves.  
All of these things help you focus.  
You will not burden yourself with things you don’t need, which means Dhan Te Nan! Room for more experiences Te Na Nana! What did you learn from the previous sentence? When you begin something, finish it.  
Beginning things you really do not want to finish are half the reasons of sorrow, and anxiety in your lives.  
Similarly, do not finish something because you had begun them.  
May it be a shitty book, a bad relationship, or your bank account.  
I would suggest close the bank account, and try something you can manage.  
The focus of all life should be long term happiness.  
Not spending time on activity speculating or hoping that things will get better.  
Hope is by the way a loser’s word.  
Action.  
Not thought.  
Ultimately matters.  
I know The Secret defers but has anyone seen The Minority Report? There is a quote that stuck in my mind from Leonardo DiCaprio’s latest production on climate change “Before The Flood.”  

“The politicians sway to public opinion.”  

To me, this not only means that we can now control the politicians, but also that this idea applies everywhere.  
If I leave the house with only the keys, I will stop using half of my resources.  
That means my impact flows to consumption, oh those stupid adverts — I cannot imagine someone wakes up every morning to make the media crap on Indian television — marketing, production, and even the raw material.  
Imagine the farmer lives you could save if you only carry your keys.  
For you, this is a conscious decision.  
You will have to make it.  

You know why? My happiness is not betting Biryani on who will be next U.S presidential candidate with my guests.  
It is not talking about on how Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or gay rights or feminism or the next Flipkart Big Billion Sale matters.  
My happiness is simple.  
My happiness lies in keeping the planet alive so that your children can make better talks.
