**Journeys**  
I’ve always thought journeys to be a part of my learning experience.  
Like I have never seen things from a different perspective unless I were on a journey from one place to another.  
Once I was travelling on this train from CST to Thane and I happened to look outside the door because I was standing right at it.  
What I saw was a series of buildings that were being constructed, half done, weirdly placed, and will work in progress for somebody.  

But what I realised was because I thought about the Whys.  
I used to always question why they placed it that way.  
Why is it weird? Why is it half done? and more.  
So I used to look at all of these things as a set of ideas that must have come to someone.  

All these things around me outside of the train were only thoughts.  
Everything you see is a thought floating around.  
Everything.  
And once you understand this you can realise that if you can think, then you can also create whatever it is around you or create a new world of your own making all by yourself, without having to worry about the Hows.  

The answer to how lies in the doing.  
The doing of following your thoughts relentlessly.
