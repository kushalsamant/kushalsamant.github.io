**The Dark Knight fantasy**.  
This week I got asked a couple of times by the folks at UN, and a few other friends.  
A pretty simple question.  
And note that the mere appearance of the question does not make it simple.  

“Why do you support Trump?”

I never followed his speeches.  
I never knew his history, and I don’t watch the news except when UN Wire requires.  

Honestly I know as little about Trump as I know about your dinner last night.  
No clue.  
But I blinked.  
The way Malcolm Gladwell puts it.  
I saw a millisecond snippet of Trump somewhere, saying “He does not want war.”   And to me that was enough.  
Everybody is at war.  
Americans being the best at it.  
Not at war games, but at making war.  
And when a man stands up to say that he will do exactly what his country is not known for doing right.  
I will stand by him.  

Donald Trump has strange ways.  
He might be the biggest loser.  
For none of what will follows from today will help him win on the inside.  
He has angered a part of his countrymen to overpower him, even before getting to power.  

While we all sit here, and wonder how comic American news gets as days pass by.  
He is working.  
He is not working on fighting other countries.  
That means no more conflicts, no more climate change from conflicts, and vice versa.  
Resources for Africans, and no more trouble for UN Wire.  

“You know what he is working on? “

He is working on the inside.  
He is working at cleaning up.  
He is being a janitor.  
He has always been a janitor.  
And trust the sense of business that says,

“Those who make money are not the ones with the best product out there.  
Rather the ones who are willing to do what others will not.  
The ones who are industrious while others wish to be lazy.  
And the ones who charge for industry.”  

Donald Trump must be Bruce Wayne, when it comes to the resources at hand.  
In my opinion, this chap must love Batman.  
Not for the glamour or the resemblance.  
But for those lines Commissioner Gordon said to Foley.  

“No help will come from outside… A city must rise on it’s own.”  

Donald scaled this thought to his whole country.  
Both his grandparents are German, Mother’s from Scotland.  
Boy oh boy! He is a trained perfectionist with all that scottish resourcefulness.  
And with military discipline he picked up at his army school to go along with it.  
He’s an introvert, and relentless.  
No matter what we say, he is a republican with democratic ideals, and followers.  
He is a nationalist, and he is working on it.  
Divulging every bit of thought he can scrimmage through the blunders.  
Every resource he can find to build his country.  
And that’s a rare mix of self indulgence to be found in the world.  

“And I feel it is an Illinois thing…”

Does he not remind you of Robert Moses? Lee Iacocca? President Kennedy? Every time I look at Donald, he looks like those proud Americans from the 70’s.  
An image of those Republican funded movies, that glance right back from Lee Iacocca’s books on the automobile industry.  
Back then Detroit in the state of Illinois was known to be the world headquarters for likes of Henry Ford, and American Motor Companies.  
These are the same people who went on to build machines like the Ford Mustang.  
Things we cherish.  
And they played pride at it’s best.  
They made money off us.  
These are the same people who put money into building New York with Robert Moses.  

Yes, the shitty piece of urbanism that is New York with all those clover leaf concrete patterns of road slicing the city fabric like a knife in a cake.  
The New York you celebrate.  
The New York the New Yorkers secretly hate.  

“How? Self funding they call it.  
Just like Trump’s presidential campaign.  For what reasons? National Interest, rather the nationalist’s interests.”  

Lee Iacocca from Detroit said the same thing.  
The Ford Motor Company rivalled against Japanese car manufacturers.  
All of these people have had the same rivals“ Japan, and China.”  

Even for Donald.  
Illinois you see.  
Written all over it, in big black Chevrolets.  
That’s what they have done, will do, and never stop there.  
Industries that pollute our world, and ideas that make a big mess of urbanism.  
See my friend, all causes apart.  
For us the thing that holds value is the American industry minding their own business.  
Donald Trump is doing just that.  
His focus is on cleaning the mess that a long line of predecessors have left behind.  
Somewhat similar to what the Indian premier is upto.  
Maybe this is just a thing about the age we live in.  
Maybe the Chinese can tell you the whys, with this monkey year they figured.  
And in all this thoroughfare, they will forget about us, and they will rise up to their own little bubble.  

“And with all pride cometh the fall.”  

As history has shown us, just like Ford, Moses, and the rest of them.  
They shall crumble.  
So don’t you fret.  
I am support my country.  
And it took a lot of a time to get here.  

“To believe that all work is done pre-season.”
