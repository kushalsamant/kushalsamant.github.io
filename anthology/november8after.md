**“After.”**

**Tuesday, November 8, U.S Presidential Election 2016**.  
My dear Americans,

While I lay here emptying my fridge because my country chose to make an economic shift, pondering for years maybe but an all in one night for us, Just like those surprise tests you guys love appalled at the way your past is still trending on Twitter.  
It may be what you did not choose for.  
Knowing fully well that choosing the lesser evil is often a sad day.  
And please don’t weigh the opinion of 1 country against the troubles of the world.  
And the collective world is in the moment very real.  

But there are a few things you could feel bright about:
Everything I write about here is hard, just as every thing in life is.  
Obama is still in power.  
Trump-age, and stampede is some months away.  
Working yourself up on social media, and the world with these juvenile antics will do no good to anyone.  

Especially not yourself.  
Let FOX or whoever you trust spread the news.  
Tweeting about negative stuff spreads needless fear.  
Not anything else.  

I don’t know how your country work, but collectively you can clean up.  
Call for a re-vote if you can convince the other sane side for it.  
Or go the french way.  
Just say ‘No.  ’ How to do that? Watch ‘Pink’ for clarity.  
Or learn from your own history?

> “The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history.  .  
> Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.  

To be honest, ignore all of that.  
Pause.  
The only thing that will matter is nothing.  
With the entirety of business, and life coming to a slow pace to a near halt for a few weeks because of what my Prime Minister did.  
But there is so much chaos here, even on normal day, that panic is not something that will ever start in India.  
That’s given.  
We know that this will pass, and so do you.  
So, I spent my day thinking about what is it that I really want to do all my life? And I found not one answer with a because to it.  
I want you to know that the things that matter the most are all inside you.  
your mind, your body, everything that you cannot control.  
Not another.  
Not another person, not another country, not another reason.  
Not your guns.  
Not your money, not your capability, not your nothing.  
It is happiness, not worry.  
So take the time, look inside.  
I know it’s hard to do that in the face of harder issues.  

But slow down a bit, and work on yourself.  
I pray you will soon see clarity like these lines, not cluttered paragraph at the beginning of this post.  
If you still feel bothered then imagine that you are the only person on our planet.  
And yes the way you imagine the planet will give you all your answers.  

**Social Shifts In India**.  
I am aware of the fact that with the measures taken by the Government to end black money, the commons are suffering by the lot.  

**Effects**.  
- Sourcing money.  

This could be anybody’s everyday story, waiting on their time in a queue.  
Most people who would use cash regularly, have moved on to online wallet apps like MobiKwik, Paytm, FreeCharge AND PayUmoney to avoid waiting in long queues at the banks.  
The banks seem to have chosen to violate their terms of service to the customers by keeping 24 hours ATMs shut.  
Should the banks not need RBI Circulars, and a corresponding change of operating protocol notice to be issued to their customers.  
Whether I am legally correct or not, the banks fucked up their customer service.  

- More cars.  

This change has made it necessary for most citizens to start an early day to attend to queues.  
Small businesses that serve overseas markets will find a change of routine as the early start has shuffled wake-sleep routine.  
Also commuting is difficult without the availability of cash.  
Only commuters with a seasons ticket or a prepaid Smart Card can use the Mumbai Suburban Rail Transit System.  
The other options are Uber or Ola Cabs.  
The major effect that moving 1.  2 billion from a cash heavy parallel economy to a cashless economy is documentation.  
1.  2 billion people have to sign up into wallet applications when the first worry on most their minds is surviving a season.  
Advent of wallet applications also bring many email receipts to your inboxes.  
With 1.  2 billion people to serve on routine for such documentation, Google will need to provide for more space soon.  
And people might demand for free space since they have been shown a way of surviving by spending less due to the deficit of paper currency.  
The Kaali Peelis, and the auto rickshaws part of the transportation industry might join these taxi companies, or migrate to another kind of trade.  
Those who cannot afford the migration will be a good customer base for the education industry.  

Vocational training, and education will have more demand to enable a smoother transition of the massive unemployment scenario that develops.  
As we promote intra city motorcar transit, we are polluting collectively as a society.  

- Changing diets.  

Most small business, restaurants do not have a pay by card system.  
So the choices we make in the morning have been split in two: coffee or ATM.  
Most of us cannot buy cigarettes because of the lack of a pay by card system.  
This might mean lesser sales for ITC in the coming quarters.  
Probably even a drop in prices of tobacco products, if they choose to not siphon the difference.  
Either ways, we shall experience a healthier population.  
Have you observed that for ordering a margherita pizza on Zomato, wallet apps offer to pay you a higher cash back percentage.  
Being vegetarian is a way to riches.  
I am unsure if this is intentional or circumstantial, but chances are that people might switch to vegetarianism for reasons of money, if not climate change.  
This may nullify our collective pollution.  

**The Sunshine**.  
“Indian services need to go online to push the currency deficit to a paperless economy.  
There are many benefits of doing the shift, and a need for innovation.  

- Finding bigger markets.  

The opportunity lies in making applications.  
Applications that cover our lack of infrastructure required in a cashless economy.  
We should learn from the ways vegetable vendors run their businesses in these tough times.  
An app for vendors would make life easier for everyone.  
Facebook will make sense in this context.  
To give you clarity with a set of prospective areas, think farmers, tourists, chaiwalas, tapris, auto rickshaw drivers, trains, and the rest of us who love filter coffee everyday.  
Think of everyone we have never met, and those of use without a bank account.  
These are markets right here.  

- Support the tourists.  

Opportunity lies in making life easier for travellers.  
Wallet apps in India do not let you sign up using any mobile number with a foreign country code.  
Wallet apps do not allow use of foreign bank accounts too.  
If you are a foreign national living on forex money in India, you are pretty much screwed because of the deficit.  
Opportunity lies in serving people stuck in these circumstances.  
One way is to assign an Indian SIM card, and loan money to their wallets.  
There lies a business idea right here.  

- Save on taxes.  

Wallet apps do not require you to own a bank account, this means that you can accept payments into any wallet app, and manage life better.  
Families, and businesses can save a lot of tax by using one bank account, and many wallet app accounts.  
They could pay their employees via wallet transfers.  

Lesser tax filings for the employees.  
I agree that the government might collect lesser tax in the coming years by giving way to these apps.  
Looking at the situation from a broader perspective, no more paper, lesser logistical costs will lead to a smaller carbon footprint.  
That’s more value in it for everyone.  

India has forced her citizens to go cashless.  
You can curse the current Government or take sides with them.  
But the government has done what most probably is the best thing a government can do to curb climate change.  
A simple change that make people conscious, and rethink about their habits, what they own, what they use, their behaviours, patterns, et cetera.  
With a rise in awareness for a cashless economy, the value of the Indian Rupee will soon surpass the U.S Dollar, the value of the Indian Rupee will equal that of time in the financial capital of India.
