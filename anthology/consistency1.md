**Consistency I**.  
Do you know how powerful consistency is?
Like I said in the previously, compounding is a hedge against failing at consistency.  
This is because aa...  
let me tell you a story.  
There was an article on medium.com a few years ago.  
This article was by this guy called James Clear.  
well I read it at first and then I could never find it again I bookmarked it but it was taken down for some obscure reason which is still not clear to me yet.  
so let me just tell you just talk something I have learnt from it and let me add some of my own thoughts to it.  
The whole idea behind James article was finding the what the why and how of how we succeed in life and can keep at it.  
One of my teachers from school used to tell me that getting to the first rank is easy.  
The difficult part is staying first throughout your schooling life.  
And I think James's article answered how to do that.  
So there is a rule that I am assuming you must be very well aware of.  
It is called the Pareto principle.  
in simple terms it mean stack 20% of the effort that you put will give you 80% of the results that you get.  
Now Pareto who was in Italian economist who had a pea garden.  
In his story, Pareto discovered his rule by observing that 20% of the pea pods where producing 80% of his peas.  
And then he observed this ratio in almost everything in life and which is how he came to to publish the Pareto principle.  
What James did is exactly the same thing.  
James Clear planted a pee garden.  
But in an attempt to document and verify or understand the Pareto principle, James also installed cameras to take pictures of his pee garden.  
and James did not take the pictures from the top instead he took them from the side.  
As a result what James observed was that the speed of the pea pods that give him most of his peas wood grow sharply when they were closer to the height of all the plants around them.  
And they would continue to grow slowly when they weren't close to the height of any of the other pea pods around them.  
Now a plant needs three things to grow that James could not control.  
Light, good soil, and air.  
James could water all of them equally, but he could not control how much light a particular pod would get.  
He could not control how much of the nutrients that particular pod would absorb from the soil, and he could not control how much of the oxygen in the air around them would a pod take.  
But in his observation, James showcased with photographic proof that the parts that give him most of his produce would grow at a sharply fast speed when they were closer to the height of all the plants around them.  
I am continuing this in the next chapter.
