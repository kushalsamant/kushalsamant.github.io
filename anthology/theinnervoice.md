**The Inner Voice**
As Kushal sat in his temporary residence in Mumbai, he couldn't help but feel frustrated with the bureaucratic process of getting permission to travel back home.  
He had followed all the necessary steps, had all the required documents, and yet he was still stuck in limbo.  
He decided to take a walk to clear his mind.  
As he walked along the busy streets of Mumbai, he noticed the chaos around him.  
People rushing to get to work, vendors selling their wares, cars honking incessantly.  
But amidst all the noise, he heard a faint voice.  
It was his inner voice, telling him to trust himself and his decisions.  
Kushal realized that he had been ignoring his inner voice for far too long.  
He had always been a logical person, relying on facts and figures to make decisions.  
But he had forgotten that sometimes, the heart knows best.  
He decided to listen to his inner voice and take matters into his own hands.  
He went to the police station once again, armed with his documents and a newfound confidence.  
He spoke to the officers there, explaining his situation and pleading for their help.  
And this time, they listened.  
Within a few hours, Kushal had received the necessary permission to travel back home.  
As he boarded the bus, he felt a sense of relief wash over him.  
He had trusted his inner voice and it had led him to the right decision.  
From that day on, Kushal made a promise to himself to always listen to his inner voice.  
He knew that it would guide him towards the right path, even when he couldn't see it himself.  
And as he closed his eyes and leaned back against the bus seat, he felt a sense of peace wash over him.  
The chaos around him had faded away, and all he could hear was the gentle whisper of his inner voice.
