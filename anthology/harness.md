**Harness**  
Today is sort of my last day at <a href="https://www.theblackcanvas.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">theblackcanvas. in</a> Mummy returns at dawn, and I shall be gone.  
This cool pic of their camera harness reminds me a lot of my archer’s sling.  
Miss those days of shooting arrows in a Chikmagalur range.  
And the bow just says it well.  
The nearer the better.  
The faster you pull your string, that larger shall you miss your game.  
There is a thing this stint thought me.  
That slowness is the way to capture all beauty instead.  
Look at that amazing detail, I am sure must be driving all you wedding photographers insane.  
But the strength of a sling is in it’s straddle, and not in the bolts beware.  
I wish that you order at least of one these masterpieces, for the fun of making them, goes beyond any artistic care.  
There is so much more to do, with these on your apparel, gear.  
Watch that audience rhyme with envy, as you swing, and shoot with cameras dear.
