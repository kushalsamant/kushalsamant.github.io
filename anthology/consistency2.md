**Consistency II.**
Continuing from the previous chapter, what James inferred was that in the human perspective this is how things would play.  
Now imagine an Olympic race or rather an Olympic swimming contest.  
This is what James called "The Winner Takes It All" syndrome.  
In an Olympic contest the difference between a winner and the person who comes as a runner up, can be defined by a split microsecond.  
But the reward that someone who comes second gets is nothing.  
Zero.  
Zilch...  
compared to the report that the winner gets.  
The winner will get better coaching better sponsorships better events better leagues the gold ofcourse and other things that come with winning.  
Which means that now the winner is in a position to compete better.  

You have to remember that the winner is being able to get all the goodstuff due to a slight difference in performance.  
Which means that the winner has to be slightly better in every race when compared to all his competitors to keep up on this winning spiral.  
Now in a very common real world scenario that is you and me.  
For us, it means that next time you go to a job interview, you don't have to be the best in class or the gold medalist at the university or the best in your field to crack the job interview.  
All you have to do, is to be slightly again slightly better than the other applicants.  
Remember "slightly".  
I will continue this in the next chapter.
