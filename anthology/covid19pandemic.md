**Covid19 pandemic**  
"I think NatGeo cooked SARS-Cov-2 is a myth.  
I've had doctors who are friends/ chiefs of government Covid19 centres who said they put people on faulty ventilators provided by the government under government orders while being fully aware that those people will die if given this treatment because the government ordered these doctors to do so.  
Think mass genocide.  

Besides that #Covid19 happenned only to those who are already ill w: cancer, diabetes, due for surgery.  

So with media spreading fear,  
you agree to spend more time at home.  

*It's good for nature*,  
PLUS More WFH lifestyle means you use more AT&T WiFi (1. owned by NatGeo),  
to watch Netflix (1.  ),  
PLUS you pay more to a private electricity company,  
whereaas hospitals and #Covid19 pay the pharmaceutical industry.  

Since WHO labelled #Covid19 as a pandemic,  
This is how the World Bank funds to governments/corporations,  
shows up as salary hikes,  
and gets converted to white money."  

What do you think?
