**Do you see**? 
Do you see.  
The mist, and the mountains tonight?
The wind that blows into the land? 
How beauty beat age again? 
The sails that ruin the rain? 
How sin can be found in the chords? 
The air that reeks of smell? 
How grammar changes the thought? 
The cold in the dark night sky? 
How bright these city lights are? 
These things that block out the stars? 
How no order this song has inside? 
How quietly can meta survive? 
It ain’t no fault of thine? 
Why you should never give up for some wine!
